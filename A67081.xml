            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>Shewing the great Advantages that</hi> Husbandry <hi>bringeth to Trade, and the dependencies the later hath on the former.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IN the <hi>Preface</hi> to my former Treatiſe of <hi>Husbandry,</hi> I did
<pb n="ij" facs="tcp:107214:4"/> ſomewhat elucidate the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and utility thereof, it being an Art that hath the leaſt dependency on other Arts of any whatſoever, being content with only a few Tools for the breaking the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Clods of the Earth, and the more eaſie ſeparating the Seed from the Husk; when there is no other <hi>Science, Art,</hi> or <hi>Trade,</hi> but hath mediately or immediately an abſolute reliance or dependency on <hi>Husbandry,</hi> or ſome of its Branches; As <hi>Cicero</hi> once ſaid, <hi>Praeclare &amp; ille dixit, qui perhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buit Agriculturam aliarum Artium Matrem eſſe ac Nutricem.</hi> More eſpecially the Martime Trade of the whole World hath for the moſt part regard to the Products of the Earth obtained by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Labour and Induſtry: As
<pb n="iij" facs="tcp:107214:4"/> the <hi>Silks</hi> and <hi>Spices</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> the <hi>Sugar, Tobacco, Indico,</hi> &amp;c. of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi> firſt advanced Trading thither, and are yet the principal Commodities which allure our <hi>Europeans</hi> to make ſo long and dangerous Voyages into thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Parts. As for <hi>Metals</hi> and <hi>Minerals,</hi> another part of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Trade, although I have not treated hitherto of them, yet may their extraction out of the obdurate parts of the Earth be deem'd a Branch of <hi>Agriculture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is particularly obſerv'd, that the planting of ſome certain Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Vegetables, in places where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they delighted, hath acquired unto, and maintain'd a Trade there: As the planting of <hi>Tobacco</hi> in <hi>Virginia, Sugar</hi> in <hi>Barbadoes, Currans</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Zant, Vines</hi>
                     <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:107214:5"/> in the <hi>Canaries</hi> and in <hi>France.</hi> The like Inſtances may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced of many other places, that by this Art of <hi>Agriculture</hi> only, have been infinitely enrich'd, and their Trade advanced.</p>
                  <p>It will be objected (I know) that there are many places very much enriched and improved by Trade, that have very little of <hi>Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> uſed therein; nor have the Inhabitants thereof but little Land to till or improve, having not Corn enough of their own grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to feed them: As <hi>Venice,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> &amp;c. and yet no places flouriſh more than theſe by Trade only. To which it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That although they have but little Land of their own, yet are they and their Trades main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:107214:5"/> by the Husbandry of their Neighbours: As <hi>Middleburgh</hi> in <hi>Zealand, Amſterdam</hi> in <hi>Holland, Hamborough,</hi> &amp;c. depend on, and are maintained by the Husbandry of their Neighbouring <hi>Germans, Danes,</hi> &amp;c. from whom they have their Corn, Cattel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to whom in lieu thereof they carry their own Manufactures, and the Products of foreign Countries. And one of the particular Reaſons why they grow ſo rich and great on ſo ſmall Territories, is the ſituation of their Countries, lying as places of Reſt, in their Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions between one Country and another, and of refuge and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the Attaque of Enemies, wherewith the Seas are generally incumbred: And it doth not at all leſſen the Obligation that <hi>Trade</hi>
                     <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:107214:6"/> hath to <hi>Husbandry;</hi> becauſe many Countries, Cities, and places thrive ſo well where Husbandry is not uſed.</p>
                  <p>For the City of <hi>London,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding its great Trade, and many Noble and Wealthy Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants in it and its Suburbs, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubſiſt without the Husbandry of many of the Neighbouring Counties, whoſe daily labour and induſtry in that Art, are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal means of preſerving and maintaining that great <hi>City,</hi> not only in their habitations and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries for life, but in many things uſeful towards the Support of their Trade and Traffic.</p>
                  <p>And it is alſo obſervable, That where <hi>Agriculture</hi> is ſlighted, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, or not uſed, Trade is not conſiderable in ſuch places: As
<pb n="vij" facs="tcp:107214:6"/> on the incultivated Coaſts of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> and <hi>America;</hi> In ſome places whereof little is to be had by our Merchants, beſides the Skins of Wild Beaſts, or <hi>Elephants</hi> Teeth; and in other places nothing at all. Although the Soil may be rich, and the Countries populous, but with Inhabitants lazy and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, feeding on the Productions of Nature, without any other labour or induſtry, than Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Fowling, or gathering of Fruits.</p>
                  <p>In that great Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſince the Expulſion of the <hi>Moors, Agriculture</hi> hath been much neglected, which hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced that Kingdom to ſo mean a Condition, as to its Trade, that it would be of little worth, did not other Nations maintain it, for
<pb n="viij" facs="tcp:107214:7"/> the lucre of its <hi>American</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts.</p>
                  <p>The fertile Kingdom of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for want only of People to cultivate its rich and vaſt Waſts and Territories, maintaineth but a ſmall Trade in compariſon of its Neighbours.</p>
                  <p>So that if it be granted that an induſtrious tilling and improving of Lands, is a principal means to beget and ſupport a Trade; and that the neglect thereof, or the inaptitude of a place for Tillage be likewiſe a means of the decay or defect of Trade; then will it not be denied, that Trade hath a dependency on <hi>Agriculture;</hi> and that to promote this noble and ingenious Science and Art of <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture,</hi> is one of the principal Encouragements to Trade, and
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:107214:7"/> will furniſh the Tradeſman and Mechanic, not only with all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials whereon to imploy his Art and Cunning, but with Food and Rayment for him and his Family, whilſt he is advancing the Trade of the Nation, and heaping up Riches for himſelf and his Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>To deſcend to particulars with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this flouriſhing Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> (our Native Soil;) It is moſt evident, that in ſuch parts thereof, where there is the greateſt plenty of Materials to work on, and neceſſaries for the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, there is the greateſt Trade managed: As in <hi>Shropſhire</hi> and places adjacent, where there is great plenty of <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Coal,</hi> and cheap living for the Workmen, by reaſon of the plenty of all ſorts
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:107214:8"/> of Food, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the Earth produces through the labour and induſtry of the Husbandman, Vaſt quantities of all ſorts of Iron-work uſed in Building, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are there made, not only to ſerve the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occaſions of many in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but to furniſh Foreigners withall, to the great encreaſe of the National Trade abroad.</p>
                  <p>The like may be ſaid of <hi>Shef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, Rippon, Bedal,</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> famous for driving the Trades of <hi>Cutlers, Spurriers, Lori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> &amp;c. All which ſorts of Iron-Ware cannot be made at ſo low Rates in other places, where Meat, Drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not ſo cheap, ſo as to maintain a general Trade to advantage, notwithſtanding there may be the like plenty of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials to be wrought upon: And
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:107214:8"/> yet in theſe places of Trade the Husbandman thrives better, than where a Market is wanting. For a quick Market, although at a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable price, is his delight.</p>
                  <p>Many places in this Kingdom are famous for the divers Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures made of <hi>Wool,</hi> by reaſon of the plenty of that Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and of the Products of Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry. For thoſe Manufactures are generally made in places where the Markets for Proviſions are reaſonable, which with the Frugality of the <hi>Spinners, Weavers,</hi> &amp;c. ſupport that Trade. For we ſee that the <hi>French,</hi> who buy <hi>Wool</hi> here, export it with difficulty and coſt; yet by their cheap living in their own Country make it into Cloath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſell it at as low Rates in Markets abroad as the
<pb n="xij" facs="tcp:107214:9"/> 
                     <hi>Engliſh:</hi> From whence it is not unreaſonable to conclude, that if we have our Proviſions for the Back and Belly cheaper than they (our <hi>Wool</hi> here being to be had at lower Rates than they can have it) we may under-ſell them in any place of the World. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to maintain our Cloathing-Trade abroad, and leſſen theirs, we muſt be obliged to the Husband-man, and the parſimonious living of ſuch Mechanics that are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in theſe Trades.</p>
                  <p>And as our Husbandry brings plenty to the Market, and ſuch plenty ſupporteth and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth the Mechanic; ſo it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe produceth many Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, which without any, or very little, of the aid or aſſiſtance of any other than the Husbandman
<pb n="xiij" facs="tcp:107214:9"/> and the Merchant, beget and maintain a conſiderable part of the Trade of this Kingdom, by their being annually exported into foreign Parts: As <hi>Wheat, Rye, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Oates, Beans, Hops, Linſeed, Peaſe, Fruits, Cloverſeed, Rapeſeed:</hi> And alſo <hi>Lead, Coals, Clay,</hi> and ſeveral other ſorts of ſubterranean Commodities. And ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Fiſh</hi> are likewiſe annually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, which although they are not obtain'd by <hi>Agriculture,</hi> yet are they taken out of our <hi>Rivers</hi> and <hi>Seas</hi> by the Labour and Induſtry of our Country-men, and in part conduce to the advancement of Trade: Alſo ſeveral ſorts of Beaſts and other Animals are raiſed throughout the Kingdom, which are either tranſported <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> as Horſes,
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:107214:10"/> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or yield ſome Commodity for the Merchant, as <hi>Butter, Cheeſe, Bacon, Ox-Bones, Leather, Coney-Skins, Coney-Furre, Wool, Wax, Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, Horn,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Husbandry</hi> of <hi>England</hi> likewiſe produceth ſeveral Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials on which the Mechanical part of the People imploy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: As <hi>Wool</hi> for the making of <hi>Cloath, Serges, Bays, Flannel, Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Hats,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Hair,</hi> for the making of <hi>Hair-Cloathes, Lines, Buttons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Skins</hi> of Beaſts, for the making of <hi>Shoes, Gloves,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Corn</hi> and <hi>Grain,</hi> for the making of <hi>Bisket, Beer, Mum, diſtilled Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Seeds,</hi> for the making of Oils, as <hi>Linſeed, Rapeſeed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iron-Oar</hi> for the making of <hi>Iron, Steel,</hi> and an infinite number of <hi>Tools, Inſtruments, Nails, Locks,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:107214:10"/> made of that Metal; and fine <hi>Clay</hi> for the making of <hi>Tobacco-Pipes,</hi> and great variety of <hi>Earthen-Ware,</hi> which are glazed with our Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, with very many other Wares and Commodites that are either exported, as they are at firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, or otherwiſe wrought into ſome other form by the Art of the Workman. By all which means the Foreign Trade of this Kingdom is ſupported, and our great and numerous Fleets trading to all quarters of the Earth main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                  <p>In return whereof are imported <hi>Raw Silks, Camels Hair,</hi> and <hi>Goats Hair, Cotton, Elephants Teeth,</hi> &amp;c. which being wrought here into various forms, are again exported to the great advantage of Trade. It is true that the Artificers, that
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:107214:11"/> for the moſt part, convert theſe foreign Commodities into Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, to the great Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Value, inhabit in or near <hi>London,</hi> and gain much Riches by their Pains and Induſtry, where Proviſions are dearer than in the remote parts in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: The reaſon whereof is, that the City is the place for the Importation of thoſe Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the place where curious Artificers, as well Strangers as Natives, Inhabit; and where they have the greateſt Encouragement by their great Wages they make of their Skill and Induſtry: And the greatneſs of the Domeſtic Trade there, takes off the greater part of their Manufactures; (part thereof being exported) and for that no other Port in this Kingdom hath
<pb n="xvij" facs="tcp:107214:11"/> a Trade ſufficient for the Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſuch Manufactures.</p>
                  <p>Another Return of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities exported, are ſuch things that are neceſſary to ſupport our Healths, and add to the pleaſure of our Lives, and ſatisfaction of our Minds: As <hi>Spices, Druggs,</hi> divers ſorts of <hi>Fruits, Sugars, Wines, Silver, Gold, Copper, fine Linnen, Paper,</hi> &amp;c. Great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities whereof are annually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and conſumed in this Kingdom, to the no ſmall En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Trade, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of Husbandry.</p>
                  <p>Thus by the Richneſs of our Soil, the great plenty of Mines, Minerals, Timber, Woods, Corn, Grain, Cattel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Labour, Induſtry, and Ingenuity of the Husbandmen is the Trade of
<pb n="xviij" facs="tcp:107214:12"/> 
                     <hi>England</hi> maintained, which hath made it Famous throughout the Univerſe, That it is moſt worthily eſteem'd the <hi>Queen of Iſles,</hi> and made it Rich and Powerful: Its Store-houſes being Replete with the Riches of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and other parts of the World; and its Inhabitants cloathed with the Silks of <hi>Aſia;</hi> Their Coffers filled with the <hi>Metals</hi> of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>America;</hi> and every one from the greateſt almoſt to the meaneſt ſolacing themſelves on the rich <hi>Cates, Wines,</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> and other foreign Parts.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the more Foreign Trade is encouraged and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, the better will the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman thrive, becauſe his Commodities will be the better vended. And the more Husbandry
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:107214:12"/> encreaſes, the more plenty will there be of its Products to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and maintain that Trade. For it is the plenty and the lowneſs of the Prizes of our Native Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities that begets and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a Trade abroad.</p>
                  <p>It is not the great conſumption of our own Products that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth our Wealth, as is vulgarly thought: For the more we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, the leſs is left to tranſport, and the Rates of it the higher, and ſo the Trade the leſs. As in Wheat and other Grain in ſuch years wherein we have plenty, and that the Prizes are low, much is exported, becauſe our Merchants are able to underſel others in Foreign Markets. And what quantities ſoever are vended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad we have ſuitable Returns
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:107214:13"/> for the ſame. Now were there any contrivance in a plentiful year of Corn, to make a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption at home of a part of that Crop, whereby to enhance the prizes to the enriching of the Farmer; this would be ſo far from being an enriching of the Nation, that it would manifeſtly appear to be a loſs. For it is not the gain of the Husbandman, in his ordinary way of Husbandry, by the riſe of his Commodity, nor of a Tradeſman in his ordinary way of Trade, that enriches the Nation. As in this preſent year 1688. this Nation is bleſſed with a double Crop of Wheat, and a plenty of all other Grain. Now to export a moyety of this Crop, would very much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage the whole, when a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:107214:13"/> at home would only a few.</p>
                  <p>It is not the burying of our Woollen that advantageth the National Trade, but would rather be a prejudice to it, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming ſo great a quantity of that Commodity; were it not that it prevents the Conſumption of the like quantity of Foreign Linnen. For the more Wool our Flocks yield, and the lower the price of it is, and the cheaper our Proviſions are, the <hi>Clothier</hi> can the better afford his Cloaths at a reaſonable rate to the Merchant, and he the better diſpoſe of them in a foreign Market. The like may be ſaid of all other Growths and Manufactures.</p>
                  <p>But here it will be objected, that when Wool is at a low price,
<pb n="xxij" facs="tcp:107214:14"/> Foreigners buy it, tranſport it, and convert it abroad into Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, and by that means un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſel us, to the great prejudice of Trade: To which may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That it is our faults that we cannot work it, ſo as to afford a better Pennyworth than they: And ſome of the Reaſons why we work not ſo cheap as Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers do may be theſe:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Our Land is very fruitful, and yields more encreaſe for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Food, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than there are Inhabitants to conſume it, which begets a Lazineſs in the meaner ſort of People in many places, that they will not work hard, becauſe eaſie Labour will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them: As on the contrary may be perceived by the more Induſtrious (for all are not Lazy,
<pb n="xxiij" facs="tcp:107214:14"/> nor is it a Diſeaſe in all parts of the Kingdom,) who by their Labour in ſeveral Mechanic Trades, as well as by Husbandry, do not only maintain their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and bring up their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to work, but encreaſe in Riches, laying up for their Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities: Which Indicates</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> Want of Inhabitants: For were there more Hands, more Work might be done, more Proviſions ſpent, to the Incouragement of Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, and there would be more Husbandmen imployed; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of raiſing the prizes of Tillage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there would be a greater plenty. For our Lands, if well tilled, would in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility yield Proviſion enough for three times the People more than
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:107214:15"/> now it doth. For if there were more People, they muſt work cheaper; and if Proviſions were more plenty, they might the better afford it. And in caſe that People were multiplyed, by conſequence Trade would encreaſe, and Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs decreaſe, it being only the Richneſs of the Country, with the paucity. of Inhabitants, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets ſo great a Pigritude: No places yielding more <hi>Commoners, Vagrants,</hi> or idle People, than thoſe parts where no public Trade is managed; Imployment at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting People, and People ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending the encreaſe of the Earth, which begets a quick Market, the Joy of the Husbandman; and the better the Land is tilled, the more plenty and cheap the Product is.</p>
                  <pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:107214:15"/>
                  <p>There are other Reaſons why our Manufactures of Woollen, Linnen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not Wrought ſo cheap here as in other Countries, and why our Country is not more peopled than it is, which have been at large ſet forth by others; and the treating of them, and the removing ſome Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Trade, appertain to others, and not to a plain Ruſtic. Only here may be obſerved, That the Prodigality of our Gentry and Citizens, and the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of our home Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, Manufactures and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which ſeemingly are the occaſions of great Returns, and encreaſe of an Inland-Trade, and the enriching of many private Tradeſmen and others, is not in any wiſe profitable to the whole:
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:107214:16"/> But on the contrary, Parſimony in all our Neceſſaries, whether Foreign or Domeſtic, is moſt advantageous to the Kingdom in general; for the leſs of our own we conſume, the more we have to ſell to our Neighbours, and the cheaper; for Plenty and low price attracts a Trade; and the leſs of Foreign we conſume, the more of their Coin or Bullion would be brought in Exchange for our Commodities: So that inſtead of the Surpluſage of their <hi>Wines, Fruits, Silks,</hi> &amp;c. more than we need, our <hi>Bullion</hi> would encreaſe. For it was the over-balance of our home Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and Manufactures exported, to ſuch that were imported, that from time to time brought into our Hands thoſe vaſt quantities
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:107214:16"/> of Gold and Silver, that for the plenty of thoſe Metals we ſeem to Vie with the Maſters of the <hi>Indian</hi> Mines; and it is the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing of ſuch an overbalance that muſt maintain that Import, and the defect thereof may in time occaſion the Exportation of the ſame Riches. As ſometimes hath happened, that in a year of ſcarcity of Corn here, which uſually happens once in 10 or 12 years, that we are forced to buy of our Neighbours. Their plenty draws great Sums of ready Mony out of our Pockets, becauſe we want more of their Corn than they of our Manufactures, or other Wares.</p>
                  <p>Therefore to conclude this ſhort <hi>Preface,</hi> My advice is to the honeſt Husbandman, to Educate
<pb n="xxviij" facs="tcp:107214:17"/> his Children to Labour, and to Live ſparingly; and to the Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to be diligent in his Calling, to the encreaſe of the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of the Nation. And to all others (to whom Honours, Preferments, and Eſtates have not deſcended, whereby to maintain or employ them in Higher or other Capacities equally neceſſary to ſupport Order, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> To em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themſelves and their Stocks in managing of <hi>Agriculture</hi> or Trade. And to propoſe and find out the moſt eaſie and frugal ways of doing ſuch things that now require great coſt and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to accompliſh. As in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Rivers Navigable to faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate that troubleſome way of Carriage now uſed, which in many places may be done.
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:107214:17"/> In making Wains, Carts, Ploughs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be drawn with leſs ſtrength than now they are, in making High-Ways more paſſable, and in erecting Bridges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the fewer Cattel are employed in Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, the more may be ſpared to ſend abroad; and the fewer hands uſed thereabouts, the more may be ſpared for Mechanic Arts; for it's much more profitable to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our Commodities wrought than unwrought. For the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the ſeveral Rivers Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable to <hi>Oxford, Guildford,</hi> &amp;c. hath conſiderably added to the Husbandry and Trade of thoſe Towns, and leſſening humane Labour within theſe few years. The uſe of Waggons inſtead of Pack-Horſes, where they could be uſed, hath much abated the price
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:107214:18"/> of Carriage. The uſe of Stage-Coaches hath likewiſe given a greater liberty for People to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel through moſt of the great Roads of <hi>England,</hi> to the great encreaſe of Trade. And the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens uſe of <hi>Pattons,</hi> a ſeeming inconſiderable Invention, hath ſaved the wearing of a great deal of Leather, whereby there hath been much the more of it to be ſpared for Exportation wrought or unwrought. The <hi>Saw-Mill</hi> on the <hi>Thames-Bank,</hi> hath, by the force of the Wind, done the work of many hands, which is much to the Public advantage. The like would any Inſtruments be that could but leſſen the labour of Man or Beaſt.</p>
                  <p>If all our Corn were to be beaten in Mortars, as in <hi>Heſiod</hi>'s
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:107214:18"/> time, inſtead of being ground in a Mill; and all our Wares, Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> carried from place to place on Horſe-back, as in ſome places now it is inſtead of in Waggons or Carts, and all the Water car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from its Fountains to the reſpective houſes in or near <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> as for the moſt part it was before the <hi>New-River</hi> was made, and the various Engins erected to convey it from the <hi>Thames;</hi> what a vaſt number of People and Horſes muſt be then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed?</p>
                  <p>It is true, it would maintain a great number of People, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a very great private Trade to ſome People in ſome places: But would very much leſſen and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh the Trade of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in general.</p>
                  <pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:107214:19"/>
                  <p>Here it will be objected, that heretofore before many of theſe new Inventions, we had a great foreign Trade. To which I will only anſwer, That then our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours were not ſo ingenious, nor ſo much addicted to Trade as now they are; for had not we hitherto kept pace with them in Ingenuity and Induſtry, they had long ſince devoured our Foreign Trade: Therefore as they thrive, we muſt emulate them. For Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence hath ſeated us on an Iſland yielding all ſorts of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, Mineral, Animal and Vegetable, for the promoting and carrying on of Trade: Having many ſecure Ports for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Trade. And its temperature of Air and ſituation on the Globe ſuch, that it exceeds
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:107214:19"/> all other places whatſoever yet diſcovered: That if its Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry be neglected, and its Trade decayed (which neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows) it muſt very much reflect on the <hi>Genius</hi> of its Inhabitants, which to do, there hath been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto no cauſe: No Nation under the <hi>Sun</hi> producing ſo <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, Active, Valiant,</hi> and <hi>Wiſe</hi> a People for the Management of their Trades and Occupations at Home, and ſpreading their Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Factories, and multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Effects abroad.</p>
                  <p>One of the great Advantages to Husbandry and Trade of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is, that there is not a Vill in it but is ſituate within 20 Miles of the Sea, or ſome River Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable, or that may be by Art and Induſtry ſo made, whereby
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:107214:20"/> carriage of heavy Commodities uſeful in Foreign or Domeſtic Trade may be cheap: As Timber, Stone, Coal, Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which not only eaſeth the labour of many Hands, ſparing them for other uſes, but the better furniſheth all Markets with ſuch Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they want of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the cutting and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Rivers Navigable, is very much to be encouraged, as of Public Uſe and a National Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and ſo hath it been eſteemed in Foreign Countries. The Navigation on cut Rivers advancing the Trade of many rich Cities and Towns in the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Netherlands,</hi> and <hi>united Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi> uſually called <hi>The Low Countries.</hi> And great have been
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:107214:20"/> the Attempts of Emperors and Princes abroad in cutting Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, uniting of Rivers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As in cutting a paſſage between the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> and the <hi>Red-Sea:</hi> The making Navigable the <hi>Iſtmus</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> thereby to make ſafe and ſpeedy paſſages from one Sea to another. Attempts have been likewiſe made to unite great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as the <hi>Loire</hi> and <hi>Seine</hi> at <hi>Briare</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Soane</hi> and the <hi>Moſella</hi> on the Confines of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the Rivers <hi>Redintz</hi> and <hi>Altmul</hi> near <hi>Regensburg</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> began by <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> which had it been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, would have opened a Navigable Paſſage from the <hi>Rhine</hi> to the <hi>Danube.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the greateſt Work that hath been attempted and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:107214:21"/> is the cutting the <hi>Royal Canal</hi> of <hi>Languedoc;</hi> making a Navigable paſſage from the Port of <hi>Cette</hi> on the <hi>Mediterranean-Sea</hi> into the <hi>Garronne,</hi> which emptieth it ſelf into the Weſtern Ocean, which is eſteem'd not only the greateſt and moſt ſtupendious Work in <hi>France,</hi> but of the whole World. It was firſt propoſed by Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu,</hi> began in the year 1668. and carried on with great Skill, Coſt and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and finiſhed <hi>Anno</hi> 1686. The length of the <hi>Canal</hi> is ſaid to be 50 or 60 <hi>French</hi> Leagues in length, and in breadth 12 or 15 fathom, that Veſſels of good Burthen may paſs eaſily; its depth about 8 or 9 Feet.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Canal</hi> hath its ſupply of Waters from ſeveral Rivers by
<pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:107214:21"/> other <hi>Canals</hi> made to convey them into this <hi>Channel</hi> of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication between the two Seas. Beſides which there are great Treaſures of Water coming of other <hi>Streams</hi> of <hi>Rain</hi> and of <hi>Snow,</hi> reſerved to ſupply any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Waters that may in times of Drought happen in the <hi>Royal Canal</hi> or <hi>Channel</hi> of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: This <hi>Canal</hi> is alſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by a Stone-Bridge over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Navigable River; and in another place it paſſes through a Hill in an arched paſſage of 26 fathom in length: In this <hi>Canal</hi> are ſaid to be 23 <hi>Locks,</hi> all of Stone-Work, for the raiſing of the Veſſels, I ſuppoſe as they paſs from the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> towards the <hi>Garronne;</hi> for it is to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the Sea at <hi>Cette</hi> or
<pb n="xxxviii" facs="tcp:107214:22"/> 
                     <hi>Montpelier,</hi> is equally or very near level with the Sea below <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi> at the Mouth of the <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronne.</hi> And it is evident, that the <hi>Garronne</hi> from <hi>Tholouſe</hi> runneth at leaſt five times farther than is the diſtance between it and the <hi>Mediterranean-Sea;</hi> and the <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronne</hi> is upon a continual deſcent, and becauſe there is a ſufficient ſupply of Waters, Veſſels may paſs without help of <hi>Locks:</hi> But the <hi>Royal Canal</hi> having only Water to preſerve it full, muſt be made level, and its deſcents towards the <hi>Mediterranean-Sea</hi> muſt be by Artificial <hi>Locks,</hi> and in number as is their depth, and the declination of the Country. By this <hi>Canal</hi> may be tranſported all Commodities from the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean-Sea</hi> to <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> and all
<pb n="xxxix" facs="tcp:107214:22"/> that Coaſt of <hi>France,</hi> and ſo by conſequence to the Northern parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> without the hazard of paſſing the Streights of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> or fear of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Pirats, beſides the eaſie carriage of <hi>Wines, Corn, Oil,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I only mention this particular Work, to ſhew that great things may be accompliſhed, where <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, Honour</hi> or <hi>Glory,</hi> excite great Men to aid and aſſiſt in ſuch Enterprizes.</p>
                  <p>We have here in this Kingdom ſome Inſtances of extraordinary Actions of this Nature, which have been formerly done to the Honour of the Undertakers, and very much to the Advantage of the places where they have been done, and conſequently to the Nation in general: As the makng
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:107214:23"/> the River of <hi>Thames</hi> Navigable from <hi>Abington</hi> to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and then farther towards <hi>Lechlade,</hi> hath proved of very great Advantage to that <hi>City</hi> and places adjacent. The like the making the River from <hi>Gilford</hi> in <hi>Surrey</hi> into the <hi>Thames</hi> Navigable, hath been very advantagious to that Town and its Neighbourhood, and both of them have added much to the Trade of that Famous City of <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was once a Navigable <hi>Canal</hi> cut from the River <hi>Trent</hi> near <hi>Torksey</hi> in <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> to the City of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> where it joyned to the River that flows from thence to <hi>Boſton,</hi> and was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with Water from that River: It was ſaid to be done by Biſhop <hi>Attwater,</hi> or <hi>Henry 1ſt,</hi> as ſome
<pb n="xli" facs="tcp:107214:23"/> will have it. However it was an ancient Work, as its Name im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, being called <hi>Foſſedike,</hi> and is viſible to this day, although wholly uſeleſs, perhaps ſuffered to decay by reaſon the Advantages ariſing thereby might be but ſmall, <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Boſton</hi> being neither far from <hi>Lincoln,</hi> or perhaps when the Trade of that City decayed (which hath been heretofore very great, as hath been ſaid) this <hi>Canal</hi> was neglected.</p>
                  <p>But the greateſt Work of this Nature that hath been done in this Age in this Kingdom, was the cutting that famous <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi> from <hi>Ware</hi> to <hi>Iſlington,</hi> whence by Pipes its Water is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the greateſt part of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and its Suburbs. A Work not only eternizing the Fame of the
<pb n="xlii" facs="tcp:107214:24"/> Undertaker, but of infinite ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to his Succeſſors and that great City.</p>
                  <p>It is not impoſſible ſo to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large it as to make it Navigable for Wherryes and ſlender Barges, for the paſſage of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the eaſie carriage of all manner of Commodities to the Markets of that great <hi>Metropolis,</hi> and the return of Coals and other Goods back again. For there is Water enough in the River <hi>Lea</hi> at <hi>Ware</hi> to maintain a full Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel all the year, to carry Veſſels of good Burden, and to maintain currents of Water in moſt of the principal Streets of the Famous City of <hi>London,</hi> which would not only keep them clean and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, but be ready on all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if ſudden Fires ſhould happen.</p>
                  <pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:107214:24"/>
                  <p>There are many other <hi>Rivers</hi> that either flow into the <hi>Thames</hi> or other (already made) <hi>Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable Rivers,</hi> or into the Sea, that may be made Navigable, to the very great advantage of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Towns and Countries, and of the general Trade of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. For it is moſt certain, where there is Water enough to make a full Channel, and ſupply the conſtant Expence and Leakage of the Locks, the making of ſuch River Navigable will be feazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, notwithſtanding the deſcent or fall of the River be quick: For where the deſcent is quick, as from <hi>Salisbury</hi> to <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> and from <hi>Wincheſter</hi> to <hi>Southamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi> although there be plenty of Water, yet it is uſually broad and ſhallow, and therefore not
<pb n="lxiv" facs="tcp:107214:25"/> naturally Navigable, nor to be made ſo without many <hi>Locks</hi> and artificial <hi>Canals;</hi> for the Current will otherwiſe be ſo ſtrong, that laden Veſſels are not eaſily haled againſt it: Such Rivers require too much coſt for a private Purſe to undertake to advantage. But if there be Water enough, as in many Rivers in <hi>England</hi> there is, and the deſcent not too quick, <hi>Locks</hi> will raiſe Veſſels into the new-cut<hi>-Canals,</hi> through which, although heavy laden, they will paſs with eaſe. It is obſerved, that the Water deſcends from <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> above 200 Foot, yet is that River Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the help of <hi>Locks:</hi> And that at <hi>Fontain,</hi> four or five miles from <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> one River is by Art carried over another for Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation-ſake.
<pb n="xlv" facs="tcp:107214:25"/> It's the eaſie carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Goods from one place to another that makes ſo many and rich Cities and Towns, and Trade flouriſh in thoſe Countries, and without doubt would do the ſame here.</p>
                  <p>It is not the ſetting down the Expence of making a River Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable, and then ſetting down the Income of the Toll, and ſo caſting up, Whether it will bring in as much <hi>per annum</hi> as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Mony to be expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amounts to, that will make Rivers Navigable. If thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences had been rightly caſt up, the River from <hi>Ware</hi> to <hi>Iſlington,</hi> and that from <hi>Guildford</hi> to the <hi>Thames</hi> had not been yet begun: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be twenty times the Intereſt of ſuch Expences advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to ſome or other, beſides the
<pb n="xlvi" facs="tcp:107214:26"/> Public. Therefore ſuch great Undertakings where ſo many are concerned in the Profits, ought to be at the Expence of many: As the Reparations of ſome High Ways, Bridges, Havens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have been at the Charges of more than the adjacent Inhabitants, becauſe the Profits extend farther.</p>
                  <p>It hath been a long time under Conſideration, and ſeveral have pretended to be Undertakers of it, <hi>viz.</hi> The Uniting of the River of <hi>Thames</hi> with that of <hi>Avon</hi> that flows to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> making a Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable Communication between the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Briſtol.</hi> The poſſibility of accompliſhing this Enterprize hath been much argued, and I will not here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend againſt it, ſuppoſing the ſame may be done, ſo that there be Water enough to ſupply ſuch
<pb n="lxvii" facs="tcp:107214:26"/> a <hi>Navigable Canal</hi> that muſt be made between the Heads of two ſmall Streams that lead to each River, which will be very difficult to be had, where there is no other Stream or River near, to be brought into it, to ſupply it. For it is not a little Water that muſt maintain ſuch a <hi>Navigable Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi> in the Summer-time, and the Leakage of the Locks at each end, which muſt be for raiſing up and letting down of Veſſels, that ought daily to paſs through this <hi>Channel;</hi> and in caſe there ſhould be a conſtant ſupply of Water, yet would the Expence of making ſo many Locks as would neceſſarily be required on thoſe ſmall Streams, be ſo great, that it would be inſupportable, or at beſt very unprofitable to private Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. For a ſmall Stream hath a
<pb n="xlviii" facs="tcp:107214:27"/> much quicker deſcent than a large and heavy River, for this worketh it ſelf into a level, there being not ſo great a deſcent from <hi>Kingſton</hi> upon <hi>Thames</hi> to the ſhore at <hi>Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> as is uſually in a miles length of a ſmall River; beſides ſmall Waters are uncapable of Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, unleſs pent up to a level. But without doubt if this Work were done (in caſe it be poſſible to be done) it would be of very great uſe and advantage to all that Trade between thoſe two Cities, and an enriching of ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries adjoyning to the ſaid <hi>Channel,</hi> as well in their Husbandry as Trade.</p>
                  <p>The making of Rivers Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable being at the firſt, a Work of great Expence, is too much for private Undertakers: Therefore if there were a Fund of 20 or
<pb n="xlix" facs="tcp:107214:27"/> 30000 <hi>l. per annum</hi> raiſed out of ſome foreign Commodity, or on <hi>Coals,</hi> or the like, to be applied for that purpoſe, In a few years time many Rivers in <hi>England</hi> might be made Navigable, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Coals</hi> and other Marine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities might be imported to; and Timber, Wood, Stone, Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be exported from the more Inland-parts; and a ſmall Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition on each Barge or Veſſel would be ſufficient to maintain the Locks and Canals in repair; which would prove a very great Incouragement to Husbandry and Trade: As appeareth in all places ſituated near a Navigable River, where Farms yield good Rents, and yet plenty of all things abounds: That all places may partake of the like Felicity, is the deſire of all true <hi>Engliſhmen.</hi>

                  <p>IN my former Treatiſe of this Subject, and the firſt Chapter, I diſcourſed ſomewhat of the Matter or Eſſence of Vegetables, from which they receive their ſubſtance, That inexhauſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Treaſure from which the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, by a proper application of his Seed, extracteth ſo great Riches: I will now make ſome ſmall addition to that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in oppoſition to an Aſſertion ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times made; which is, That every Plant

                  <p>Now what can be more plain, Than <note place="margin">That there are ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of Plants.</note> that every part of this Globe of Earth (where the perpendicular Rayes of the ſcorching <hi>Sun,</hi> or the defect of thoſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting beams in the <hi>Frigid Zones,</hi> or the great quantities of <hi>Egyptian</hi> or <hi>Lybian</hi> Sands prevent not,) affords its larger Foreſts, Woods, Groves; Or its leſſer Shrubs; Or its fertile Plains, replete with great variety of ſmall Vegetables, ſome as Medicines, others as Poyſons, ſome as Food, others as Rayment to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Inhabitants, and for Paſturage to the numerous Herds and Flocks of Cattel and other leſſer Animals feeding on them, without being planted in ſuch places by Humane Induſtry, or the Seeds tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Air to ſo remote parts. The Weſtern Iſlands alſo that lie remote from the <hi>American</hi> Continent, although unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by Humane Race, yet afforded to the firſt Diſcoverers large Woods and fruitful Paſtures, which fed our European Cattel when put on ſhore, and on which they multiplied and proſpered exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; ſuch Vegetables that were ſo far
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107214:30"/> from being propagated by Seeds carried thither in the Air, or by any other means, that the Species of ſome of them are not to be found in other Countries.</p>
                  <p>The Hiſtories of the firſt Diſcoveries of the Weſtern Continent, and the Iſlands remote from Land on every ſide, will furniſh you with variety of Examples of this nature.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, there are many Plants that are ſpontaneous only at certain Seaſons, and not at other, according as the Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle or Matrix of the Earth is enclined; For ſometimes over-much moiſture, in a wet year, cauſeth Land to emit other Plants than before it did in dry years; and the laying of dry Land wet, or wet Land dry, very much altereth the Species of Vegetables that ſpontaneouſly proceed from it.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Evelin</hi> in his Philoſophical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Earth, gives an account of what Dr. <hi>Moriſon</hi> affirmed of the Plant <hi>Eryſimum</hi> or <hi>Irio,</hi> that after the Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the City of <hi>London,</hi> more of it appeared amongſt the Ruines, than was known to grow in all <hi>Europe</hi> beſides: It being (as he ſaith) a curious <hi>Exotic,</hi> to be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107214:31"/> found moſt about <hi>Naples,</hi> and but rarely elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>Examples of this nature are many, where after the felling of one ſort or Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Wood another hath ſucceeded; and where Land that hath been frequently ſown with one ſort of grain, hath produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced other grain than what hath been ſown.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Mr. <hi>Evelin</hi> in his moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Diſcourſe of Foreſt-Trees,</hi> relates from a Perſon moſt worthy of Credit, <hi>That is the Territory of</hi> Alzey <hi>(a Country in</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, <hi>where they were miſerably diſtreſſed for Wood, which they had ſo deſtroyed, as that they were reduced to make uſe of Straw for their beſt Fewel,) a very large Tract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing newly plowed, but the Wars ſurprizing them, not ſuffer'd to ſow; There ſprung up the next year a whole Foreſt of Pine-Trees of which ſort of Wood there was none at all within leſs than fourſcore miles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many other Relations there are in <note place="margin">Some aſſert that all Plants are produced of Seeds.</note> 
                     <hi>Pliny,</hi> and other Authors of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which I need not mention; Only here I cannot but take notice of the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetch't Cauſe of ſuch unexpected pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of Vegetables ſome have given,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107214:31"/> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> That becauſe God ſaid, <hi>Gen</hi> 1. <hi>I have given you every Herb bearing Seed, and every Tree in the which is the fruit of a Tree yielding Seed:</hi> Therefore all Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables are produced and multiplied of the ſeed of the ſame Species, and by no other ways, and deny all ſpontaneous Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And to back this Aſſertion, have found out a way whereby the ſeeds of all Vegetables may be conveyed from one Country to another, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Wind, from whence their Species may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed or propagated <hi>de novo</hi> in places where formerly they have not been known. And imagine that the Showers of ſeeds mentioned by <hi>Pliny</hi> in <hi>lib.</hi> 16. <hi>cap.</hi> 33. <hi>&amp; lib.</hi> 19. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. were firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled from Trees or Plants of the ſame kind; and to make this ſeem more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable or eaſie to obtain Credit, they have diſcovered that there are ſeveral Plants that produce ſeed, which formerly were reputed barren; and thoſe ſeeds ſo ſmall that with the Wind they may eaſily be tranſmitted from place to place at a very great diſtance, whereof Mr <hi>Hooke, Fellow of the Royal Society,</hi> in his little Tract, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled <hi>Lampas,</hi> gives you ſome inſtances. As that Obſervation of his own about
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107214:32"/> the ſeed of Moſs, which with his Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope he found to be very numerous and very ſmall, that there will need no leſs than nine hundred and threeſcore thouſands of them to cover the ſuperficiet of an inch ſquare; and that the number of them in a grain weight cannot be leſ than one thouſand three hundred eighty and two millions: Theſe ſeeds he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth may eaſily be drawn up into the Air and carried from place to place, even, to the tops of the higheſt Towers, or to places moſt remote, and be ſown by the paſſing Air, or falling drops of Rain; and that it is not in the art of Man to leave Earth expoſed to the common Air and to exclude the entrance, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſowing of theſe imperceptible Seeds.</p>
                  <p>Another was an Obſervation of Mr. <hi>W. C.</hi> of <hi>Eriſtol</hi> about Fern-ſeed, which he found to be likewiſe very ſmall, and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, and that the little Boxes contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeeds were in moſt of the Plants not half, and in ſome not above one third, or one quarter as big as a very ſmall grain of common white ſand; and that ſome of thoſe bladders contained about 100 ſeeds, which were ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107214:32"/> ſmall as to be wholly inviſible to the naked Eye, and indiſcoverable without a Microſcope.</p>
                  <p>I will not gainſay theſe curious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Obſervations, nor queſtion them. But theſe do not at all manifeſt that all Plants are produced of ſeeds taken from the ſame Species. For how could the Wind carry the heavy, though ſmall ſeeds, of Purſlane from the Continent above 1000 miles over the Seas to the Iſland <hi>Sancta Helena,</hi> where at the firſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thereof it plentifully grew; and the ſeeds of the <hi>Cedar</hi> from Mount <hi>Liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> or any other Continent, to the Iſland of <hi>Bermudas,</hi> where ſo great Woods and Groves of it were found at its firſt diſcovery? Or how could the Seeds of the various kinds of Graſs be wafted over ſo large Seas into all places, almoſt throughout the World, by the Air only? For although the ſeeds of them are but ſmall, yet have they their weight; and notwithſtanding they may by Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes, tempeſtuous Winds, or the like, be elevated to a great height in the Air, yet have they a tendency towards the center of the Earth, and cannot long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remain at ſuch a diſtance, as to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107214:33"/> from one Country to another, nor indeed is there any neceſſity thereof: For although every Plant may yield its ſeed by which it may probably encreaſe, yet that is no reaſon but that every ſoil may ſpontaneouſly produce ſome Vegetable it is moſt enclinable to. As ſome Seas yield <hi>Coral,</hi> ſome one ſort of Weed, ſome ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the like of other Waters; likewiſe ſome Plants yield one ſort of Excreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and ſome another, which cannot be imagined to proceed from material ſeed, no other than the variety of Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooms, Mold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which differ according to the nature of the ſoil, or the ſeveral ſubjects from whence they grow, theſe rather proceeding from the univerſal Agent, as it is more or leſs animated by the Celeſtial Sun, and as it meets with its proper Matrix, ſo it produceth ſome Plant or other. Now the uſe the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman may make of theſe natural and ſpontaneous productions, is, that by them he may diſcover the temper and ſtrength of the ground that produceth them, that he may either multiply the ſame Species, if for his advantage, or ſuch other that are conſimilar, or avoid planting or ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Land of a contrary nature.</p>

Many of the like Obſervations may the Husbandman make of the nature of his ground, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly may he apply proper ſeeds or plants to the ſame.</p>
                  <p>It hath been alſo aſſerted, That no Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals <note place="margin">That there are ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of Animals</note> are produced but by the act of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, each proceeding from others of the ſame Species. But if they that are of that opinion do conſider that there is no habitable place on this Globe that is not replete with Animals greater or leſſer, and ſome places with both, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it doth not appear how the firſt of them came thither; They will eaſily
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107214:34"/> grant, that the ſame univerſal <hi>Agent</hi> or <hi>Spiritus Mundi</hi> that never reſteth, may when it meeteth with a proper ſubject cauſe Animation, as the matter is where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it worketh; for ſome places or things being leſs prolific or fertile are apt to Vegetation, others that are more, are apt to Animation or the production of Animals by the power of the ſame Agent. As moiſt and fruitful ſeaſons and places yield more Inſects than dry and barren. And ſtanding Pools and mature Fruits naturally afford ſmall Animals, which never were generated by others, but only by the Univerſal Agent. Many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances hereof might be given; for almoſt every Plant produces ſome Inſect or ſmall Animal proper to that Plant: As the Mulbery, the Silkworm, Apples, Pears, Plums, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Worms peculiar to theſe Fruits. Nuts alſo have Worms within their ſhells there generated by the ſame natural heat or ſpirit that produced the Kernel, and not from any external ſeed or Egg; for that Worm worketh its own way out of the ſhell, and then ceaſeth to be.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W. C.</hi> (that before gave an account of the Fern-ſeed) to the admiration of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107214:34"/> him, and others with him, obſerved many differing kinds of ſmall living Creatures wholly inviſible to the naked Eye, and even through largely magnifying Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, though ſome of them were to be ſeen through a deep convex Glaſs; but with a Microſcope, when the Plant was newly gathered, they might be ſeen nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly running up and down among the ſeed Veſſels. <hi>Lampas p.</hi> 50.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it will be ſaid that theſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals are produced of Eggs repoſited there by ſome ſmall Flyes, as the proper place or Matrix for their production; as Fleſh-flyes do the like on putrifying fleſh. But why may they not be there engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by the univerſal Agent as well as Mites in Cheeſe, or thoſe nimble Fiſhes in Vineger, which are never obſerv'd to be transformed into Flyes, and ſo unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of tranſporting their Eggs from place to place?</p>
                  <p>This ſuppoſition of the ſpontaneous <note place="margin">Not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> production of Animals out of places and things capable of impregnation from that univerſal Agent, is not contrary to, but agreeable with that Command, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>Let the Earth bring forth the living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:107214:35"/> 
                     <hi>after his kind, Cattel and creeping thing.</hi> To which we will ſubjoyn the Opinion of the Learned Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> in his <hi>Origines Sacrae,</hi> Book 3. cap. 4. <q rend="inline">It ſeems very probable (ſaith he) that at leaſt thoſe parts of the Earth which were thus divided from each other, did bring forth theſe ſeveral living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures after their kinds, which did after propagate in thoſe parts without being brought thither by the help of man. If now this ſuppoſition be embraced, by it we preſently clear our ſelves of many difficulties concerning the propagation of Animals in the World, and their converſation in the Ark, which many have been ſo much to ſeek for ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in. As how the unknown kind of Serpents in <hi>Braſil,</hi> the ſlow-bellied Creature of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and all thoſe ſtrange ſpecies of Animals ſeen in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> ſhould either come into the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> or be conveyed out of it into thoſe Countries.</q> 
                     <hi>And afterward the ſame Author adds,</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline">Beſides, ſome kind of Animals cannot live out of that particular Clime where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are; and there are many ſorts of Animals diſcovered in <hi>America,</hi> and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107214:35"/> the adjoyning Iſlands, which have left no remainders of themſelves in theſe parts of the World.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore let them that are ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently opinionated, That every thing we diſcern to have life, proceeds from an Egg; conſider from whence theſe Multitudes of <hi>Locuſts, Graſhoppers, Caterpillars, Frogs, Chaffers,</hi> &amp;c. that in ſome years and in ſome Countries do appear, although at ſuch remote diſtances of time, that in caſe they were produced of Eggs left in the Earth by ſome former flight of thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects, it will prove very difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate how life could be preſerv'd in ſuch Eggs ſo many years; or elſe how the Wind could carry them from one Country to another, or out of different Climates; or how the Eggs of Inſects could be conveyed into <hi>Nuts, Fruits, Woods, Stones,</hi> &amp;c. which frequently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford thoſe Animals: Nay, Snow it ſelf is ſaid not to be without its proper Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, although there be ſometimes two or three years interval between any quantities lying in theſe parts.</p>
                  <p>The Bodies of Men and Beaſts afford many Examples of Worms bred in the moſt inward parts, even in the Brain and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107214:36"/> Marrow of the Bones. But where they lay their Eggs, and how they ſhould be convey'd from one to another, will be difficult to determine. Therefore when I conſider of the many inſtances of this kind that may be produced, and the difficulties on the other hand, I am the more confirm'd in my opinion, That there is ſcarce any created being that hath any thing of moiſture in it, but may be a proper Matrix for the <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Agent</hi> or <hi>Spiritus Mundi</hi> to act upon for the production of ſome Animal; and according as Plants are (from ſome ſuperior influence) more corrupted, ſo do they emit greater numbers of ſome ſorts of Animals or Inſects, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Scourge to the Husbandman, whoſe knowledge of theſe things is not unneceſſary, that he may uſe means to prevent or cure ſuch Plagues. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and cure whereof in the Tenth Chapter of the former Treatiſe is partly treated of.</p>

                  <p>IN the former Treatiſe in that Chapter of this part of <hi>Improvement of Lands,</hi> I gave an account of the great advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges Encloſure would produce, and the many Objections raiſed againſt it, and Impediments that hindred it, with their Anſwers and Removals. Since the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, ſeveral worthy and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men have endeavoured to promote this Piece of Husbandry, which I may truly Stile, <hi>The firſt and principal Point of Agriculture;</hi> For unleſs the Husbandman can at all times and ſeaſons, when he pleaſeth, uſe his Land, and plant and ſow in it what he will, and defend it when he hath done, from the common annoyances to good Husbandry; It is in vain for him to uſe any extraordinary labour, or be at any extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, or hope for any advantage from it. So that there would be then no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107214:37"/> between ſtupidity and Ingenuity, and all Induſtry would be hereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged.</p>
                  <p>Some have been of Opinion, that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing <note place="margin">Profits of Encloſing Lands.</note> improves Land to a Ten-fold, others to a twenty-fold advantage; that is, that by the means of Encloſure the Husbandman may by his Induſtry on ſuch Land, in planting ſeveral Hortulanes or Orchard Fruits, raiſe aſwel to the Public as his own advantage, much more than he could on open Land ſeldom fruitful, and ſubject to almoſt all manner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſays, <hi>Ager quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumvis fertilis, ſine cultura fructuoſus eſſe non poteſt.</hi> There is no Country that is celebrated for good Husbandry or Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity in our temperate Clime, but their Lands are divided into ſeverals, as the rich Provinces of the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> The moſt fertile parts of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the World, ſufficiently evince. Nor is there any place in this Kingdom flouriſheth more than where Encloſures are moſt.

                  <p>For any Traveller may obſerve that in the encloſed Countries, the Hedges are all replete with Timber and other Trees, that they are deſervedly called <hi>The Wood-Lands,</hi> and were ſo called in former Ages: And not only with Timber for building, and Trees for firing, but with plenty of Fruit-Trees in the Hedges and Orchards diſperſed throughout, ſo that theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed Countries afford Fruits which are carried far into the Champion, and <hi>Cider</hi> in ſuch plenty, that they ſpare great quantities for their ignorant and lazy Neighbours. The Buildings alſo in theſe encloſed Countries, where Materials and Artificers are more plentifully to be had, far exceed thoſe in the Champion and Foreſt-Lands; and Market-Towns well built and populous, ſtanding much nearer
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107214:38"/> here than in the other.

                  </head>
                  <p>THe ancient Meadow-Lands in many places of this Kingdom have not born the ſame values within theſe late years as formerly they did, by reaſon of the encreaſe of that excellent and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable part of Husbandry, the ſowing of <hi>Clover-Glaſs,</hi> and other ſuch like new Graſſes and Hays: Yet are Meadow-Lands in great eſteem, and yield greater Rents than Paſture or Arable; becauſe of their producing Graſs and Hay, as is known to every Husbandman, and that they yield their encreaſe ſpontaneouſly, without Coſt or Labour; and therefore are called <hi>Prata, quaſi parata. Pliny</hi> tells us, <hi>Pratorum facilima agricolis cura ac minimi diſpendij,</hi> That Meadows require the leaſt Care or Coſts of any Lands; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore little can be ſaid to their Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107214:40"/> more than hath been ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
                  <p>But as to the great Improvements <note place="margin">Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Paſtrue-Lands a double Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.</note> made on dry Lands, by the ſowing and propagating of new Graſſes and Hayes, much hath been done, and the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that are yet to be made by a farther proſecution of that piece of Husbandry, are very conſiderable. For the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing of Meadow and Paſture-Lands is not only the Improvement of thoſe very Lands; but by the Country-mans converting of ſo much Corn-Land into Meadow and Paſture, puts him upon a neceſſity of a farther improvement of more barren Lands for an encreaſe of his Corn. So that it proves a double im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, as indeed doth all Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by altering the products of it. As converting of Paſture-Lands into Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, Orchards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> begets a neceſſity of encreaſing our Paſture-Lands on the Arable: And the converting of Arable Lands into Paſture or Meadow begets a farther Improvement, by reducing our naked and waſt Lands into fertile Corn-Fields: For where there is good Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry at the <hi>Center,</hi> it ſpreads to the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107214:40"/> 
                     <hi>Superficies;</hi> Good Tenures, Good Trade, and a good Market, will make Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ingenious.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt the ſeveral Graſſes, Hays, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Sowing of Parſley an Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> that have been mentioned by former Writers on this Subject, we do not find that Parſly hath been treated of as an Improvement to our Paſture-Lands, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome ingenious Men have made trial of ſeveral Acres ſown with Parſly-Seed to very good effect.</p>
                  <p>It is obſerv'd, that ſome ſort of Graſſes do alter the taſt of Mutton, and that the ſweeteſt Mutton is that which hath been fed on the fineſt and ſweeteſt Graſſes, as is experienced on the <hi>Peak</hi> in <hi>Derby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and on the <hi>Plains</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire, Hampſhire,</hi> &amp;c. And on the contrary, the courſeſt Mutton is produced from the groſſeſt Meadows, Marſhes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which later rich way of fatting Sheep, is moſt advantagious to the Husbandman, but doth not humour the Pallat of the Eater, ſo well as ſuch Beaſts that live on the dryeſt Mountains without water. For Sheep fatted on Clover, and the like rich Nouriſhment, are not ſo delicate meat as the Heath-Croppers; ſuch rank feed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107214:41"/> too great and ſudden a change in the Meat. The like difference is alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Conies.</p>
                  <p>Sheep fatten very well on <hi>Turneps,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Sheep fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips.</note> which prove an excellent Nouriſhment for them in hard Winters, when Fodder is ſcarce: For they will not only eat the Greens, but feed on the Roots in the Ground, and ſcoop them hollow even to the very Skin; The <hi>Turnep</hi> is of hotter nature than <hi>Clover-Graſs,</hi> and therefore more agreeable to theſe Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</p>
                  <p>But much more hot and drying is <note place="margin">Parſley preventeth the Rot in Sheep.</note> 
                     <hi>Parſley,</hi> even in both, to the ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; and were it throughly experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, doubtleſs would prove very good Nouriſhment, and not ſubject thoſe dry Animals to the <hi>Rot,</hi> nor vitiate the taſt of their Fleſh ſo much as the other colder Food would do.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Rot</hi> being a Diſeaſe occaſion'd by the <hi>Sheep</hi> their feeding on too much cold and moiſt Meat, and is prevented by hot and dry: As their feeding in ſhady pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in ſome Grounds, where the Dew lieth long on a certain broad <hi>Graſs,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107214:41"/> enclineth all <hi>Sheep</hi> feeding there; to the <hi>Rot;</hi> and by ſuch that have to their Coſt made experiment thereof, ſuch Lands have been converted to other uſes: When on the contrary, the feeding of <hi>Sheep</hi> on <hi>Salt Marſhes</hi> and <hi>Brackiſh Grounds</hi> preventeth the <hi>Rot,</hi> and the giving them <hi>Salt</hi> with their dry Meat, is eſteem'd a Cure of that Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>Parſly</hi> (being of ſuch a <hi>hot, dry, ſaline,</hi> and <hi>Anti-Hydropical</hi> nature, and as my Relators aſſure me) ſo much deſired by <hi>Sheep</hi> (as I am ſure it is of <hi>Conies,</hi> much of the nature of <hi>Sheep</hi> in reſpect of their feeding) may very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be, not only a very good ſecurity againſt the <hi>Rot,</hi> but may render the Meat rather better taſted than any other food what ſoever.</p>
                  <p>And it is a Plant very eaſily propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the Seed plentifully obtained; few Plants yielding more, and that alſo eaſily ſeparated from its Stalks: The Ground the finer it is dreſſed, the better will the <hi>Parſly</hi> ſown therein grow and proſper; and it will endure the hardeſt <hi>Winters,</hi> and continue more than one year; but how many, a careful Improver will quickly diſcover: And of what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107214:42"/> Uſes and Advantages this Piece of Husbandry may prove (beſides the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way of feeding Sheep) an ingenious Husbandman will ſoon find out.</p>
                  <p>The ſowing of Cole-Seed for the ſake <note place="margin">Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by Cole-Seed.</note> of the Seed hath been always eſteem'd a great Improvement of ſtrong and moiſt Lands. But of late it hath been found that the depaſturing the green Herbage thereof hath conſiderably advantaged the Husbandman. A particular Example whereof is related in Mr. <hi>Houghton</hi>'s <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Letters, for the Improvement of Husbandry and Trade, viz.</hi> Of one that ſowed ſix Acres of ground which he ploughed and ordered as for Wheat, with <hi>Cole-Seed</hi> about <hi>Midſummer;</hi> about the beginning of <hi>November</hi> he put an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Ewes into his <hi>Coleworts;</hi> The Ewes all caſt their Lambs before <hi>Chriſtmas.</hi> The <hi>Coleworts</hi> ſo fed theſe Ewes and Lambs, that he ſold them at a great Rate, and when the growth was eaten up cloſe, he plowed and ſowed his Lands with Oates, and had eight Quarters grown on every Acre.</p>
                  <p>To ſow <hi>Cole-Seed</hi> for the Paſture-ſake there's no need that the Land be ſo rich
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107214:42"/> and moiſt as if it were for Seed, only that it be good Wheat-Land. It maketh a good Lay for other beaten Grain; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly it kills Weeds, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſturing Sheep on it much meliorates the Land. That which is ſown about <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummer</hi> for Seed, gives you not its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe till the next <hi>Summer,</hi> but this the firſt <hi>Winter.</hi> Theſe Improvements of Paſtures by <hi>Parſley, Turneps, Cole-Seed;</hi> nor that by ſowing and feeding of Buck-Wheat, mentioned in the Fourth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of my former <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of this Subject, are not yet brought into publick uſe; but may prove very advantageous to the skilful and induſtrious Husbandman, and conſequently to the Kingdom in general.</p>

                  <p>IT hath been obſerv'd, that in a warm <note place="margin">Mowing of Wheat in the Graſs.</note> and ſhowry Spring, Wheat in rich Lands hath grown exceeding Rank, that the Husbandman hath, for the benefit of his Wheat, early in the Spring, depaſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Sheep on it to abate its growth and weight, which otherwiſe would be apt to lodge. But of late ſome (who have found that expedient too weak, where the Wheat hath grown too faſt, or that they have not had Sheep enough proportionable to their large Wheat-fields to feed it down) have mow'n their Wheat, yea as late as the end of <hi>May,</hi> when it hath been almoſt ready to Ear, after which the Roots would emit new Stalks more in number, though not ſo ſtrong and rank as the former, nor ſo apt to lodge. For the extream weight and rankneſs of the Corn would have
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107214:43"/> unavoidably made it to lodge, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat a neceſſity in the Husbandman to try this way, elſe he might have loſt his whole Crop; for Wheat lodging when it firſt begins to ſhoot its Ear, rarely ever ſtands again. Many in the rich <hi>Vales</hi> of <hi>Berk-ſhire</hi> did ſo mow their Wheat in the Year, 1683. it proving an early and ſhowry Spring: As to the effects I had no account of them; which I queſtion not but that they were anſwerable to their Intentions: For all Vegetables tend to ſemination; and the more you depreſs or take off the firſt ſhoots of any Fruit or flower-bearing Plants, the more will they multiply their proper Productions, or at leaſt will emit new Bloſſoms, Fruits, Flowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As hath been obſerv'd in many <hi>Hortulanes,</hi> as <hi>Roſes, Strawberries, Beans,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>There are divers ſorts of Wheat <note place="margin">Rath-ripe Barley.</note> which I have mentioned in my ſaid for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> and more are ſince taken notice of; of which there is one ſort that carries divers Ears on one Stalk, but not yet common. But of Barley I hear of few more than two ſorts: The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon which is univerſally known in this
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107214:44"/> Kingdom, and that called <hi>Patney</hi> or <hi>Rathripe Barley,</hi> which is ſometimes ſown in <hi>Wilt-ſhire, Berk-ſhire, Oxford-ſhire,</hi> and ſome part of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and in few places elſe, notwithſtanding the advantage of its early ripening, it having many times been ſown and returned to the Barn again in two months time, always in nine or ten weeks time at the fartheſt; which in wet and backward Springs, and moiſt Autumns, muſt needs prove a great advantage to the Husbandman. For in ſome years a very dry Spring may poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone the Seaſon for ſowing this Grain, or a man may not have time, without a double ſtrength, to ſow the common Barley before the Seaſon for that be quite ſpent; or the former part of the Harveſt-time may be fair, when the later is foul; in either of theſe caſes the ſowing of this quick growing Barley may be conſiderably advantagious; or at leaſt that where a man hath much Land in his Occupation fit for this kind of Grain, he may, inſtead of making his Seed-time and Harveſt near about a time, for this common ſort, uſe ſo much of this <hi>Rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe Barley,</hi> that his Seed-time may be longer and more eaſie, and his Harveſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107214:44"/> the like, and withall more certain. There is a ſort of <hi>Barley</hi> that is reported to be newly diſcovered, by an ingenious mans accidentally lighting on an <hi>Ear</hi> that had ſix Cheſts or Rows of Corn on it, which he ſowed, and thereby raiſed a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, all bearing the like <hi>Ears,</hi> which is likely to prove a conſiderable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt we are now diſcourſing of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, <note place="margin">Making of Malt.</note> it will not be amiſs to ſay ſomewhat concerning Malt, that being the moſt conſiderable Grain uſed for this purpoſe. Many Ages ſince hath Malt, made of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, been uſed for the making of Ale or Beer; elſe could not <hi>Pliny</hi> have given ſo great Commendations of this Drink above 1600 years ſince. Therefore who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was that firſt found the Art of making <hi>Malt,</hi> and (of that) good <hi>Ale,</hi> ſhewed himſelf to be a far greater Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, than he that firſt ſqueezed the Grape.</p>
                  <p>Although that making of <hi>Malt</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a common Trade in moſt of the principal <hi>Towns</hi> in this Kingdom, and many are exerciſed in that Trade, that do not apprehend the Reaſon why the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107214:45"/> Malting of Corn ſhould make it yield a Better and more acceptable Drink than the ſame Corn would have done before it had been malted. It will not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be amiſs in this place a little to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophize on that Subject; For it is moſt evident, that the Meal or Flower of any Corn or Grain unfermented, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted in a proportionable quantity of Water, will make a glutinous or mucilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous matter. As <hi>Laundreſſes</hi> uſually make their ſtiffening Liquors for their Linnen, of Starch, which is only the Flower of Wheat reduced into that form; and in caſe there be no more Water added than will make it up into the form of Bread, and ſuch a maſs be baked with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fermentation, it cometh forth like a lump of Clay, ungrateful to the Pallat, hard of digeſtion and unwholſome; ſo that neither Bread nor Drink made of Corn, without Fermentation, could ſatisfie our Anceſtors, which excited them to the diſcovery and uſe of Fermenting of their Bread-Corn by Leaven, and ſince that by Yeſt, which is no other than the ſcum of Ale or Beer made of malted Corn. Malting being no other than a fermentation of Corn, making it yield
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107214:45"/> to the Brewer its Spirit and Tincture, pleaſant to the Palate and wholeſome to Humane Bodies; extractions or decoctions of unfermented Grains being pale and not tinged or coloured, as are thoſe of malted or fermented.</p>
                  <p>The imbibition or ſteeping of Barley in Water for 2 or 3 days or more, as the Seaſon requires, hath this operation that it relaxeth the viſcous matter of the Grain that defendeth and preſerveth the life that is in it, from Heat and Cold; for as long as its Viſcoſity remains; the Grain or Seed is capable of Vegetation; but when by age or other accidents that is decayed, it becomes a dead Body; For ſuch relaxation muſt be made in all Seeds ſown in the ground, by the moiſture they find there, before they can vegetate or encreaſe. <note place="margin">When the Barley is in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern if it be ſtirred well, and the light Grains that float be ſcum'd off, the Malt will be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now after the Malſter hath ſteept his Barley its due time in the Ciſtern, (for it muſt not lie there too long, leſt it loſe its vegetating Vertue too much by diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving its whole body into a ſoft ſubſtance,) Then he layeth it on a heap, where it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth ſome warmth (as all moiſt Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables will do, when lying cloſe together,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107214:46"/> which cauſeth the Barley to emit its Root which they call <hi>Chitting,</hi> which the Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſuffereth to grow to a certain degree of length; then ſpreadeth it abroad, and by his careful turning, ſtirring and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual drying his <hi>now-making-Malt,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents the overmuch growth of the Roots which now are called the <hi>Come,</hi> from their hair-like form; for till the <hi>Come</hi> is out long enough, and the Corn begin to ſpring, the viſcous matter of it is not enough putrified, diſſolved, or rather changed; and if they are ſuffered to grow too much, the Stalk of the Corn will ſhoot and extract too much of the Vertue of the Grain, leaving nothing but an empty Husk behind it,</p>
                  <p>As the overmuch <hi>comeing</hi> and ſpringing of the Stalk of the Malt empoveriſheth it; So its not <hi>coming</hi> or ſpringing enough, leaveth it but in part malted or ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and ſo doth the unequal <hi>coming</hi> or <hi>ſpringing</hi> of it, that is, ſome of the whole Grains throughly malted, and ſome of them not, which is occaſioned ſometimes by the unskilfulneſs or negligence of the Malſter by not duly ordering his Heaps, or turning the ſame, whereby the Corn on the outſide of the Heap through
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107214:46"/> drought, <hi>comes</hi> or ſprings not enough; and that on the inſide through warmth <hi>comes</hi> and ſprings too much, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>Acroſpired</hi> or <hi>Akerſpired,</hi> by reaſon that the Stalk (here reſembling the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating of a growing <hi>Acorn,</hi> and which the Learned Dr. <hi>Grew</hi> calls the <hi>Plume)</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth the vertue of the Grain; or elſe from the uneven growth of the <hi>Barley,</hi> which in ſome years from the unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenſs of the ſeed-time becomes Ridge-grown, that is, ſome part thereof being grown green above the ground before the other part through drought be come up, yet by reaſon of ſome Summer Showers all growes to the Harveſt, where one part is ripe before the other, from the one of which Cauſes there is much <hi>Malt</hi> that is not good.</p>
                  <p>After the Malſter hath thus by his skill and induſtry, ſo made this Grain to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that by a certain degree of putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction the viſcous or tenacious matter of it be relaxed; and by his nimble hand hath prevented the expence of its Noble Spirit; He then makes uſe of the third part of his skill, The calcining or drying of his Malt, which puts a ſtop to all fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Germination, and makes it capable of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107214:47"/> being preſerv'd for uſe: But the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal end of it is to make it yield its <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Tincture.</hi> This calcination or drying muſt be gradual, and not haſty; for the longer <hi>Malt</hi> is drying on the Floor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be laid on the Kiln, the better will it be; for all haſty Calcinations waſt the Spirits more than ſlow.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt certain that every Seed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a great Spirit in it, ſome more and ſome leſs; For it is the Spirit in it that preſerveth it, whereby it endure ſo much Cold, Heat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as moſt ſorts of Seeds uſually do: And in this Spirit in the Seed is concentrated, the vertue, form, power and whole <hi>Idea</hi> of the Plant that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it; elſe could it not by being ſown in the Earth, preſent unto you again, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Plant in every particular like to that from whence it came. And this Spirit in <hi>Barley</hi> is very great, as may appear by its product; for one <hi>Barley</hi> Corn ſown in the Earth, hath ſometime produced 30 or 40 Stalks, and on them 5 or 600 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Seed; and by ſome additional improvement, a far greater; when the Seed of many other Plants produce but one Stalk to each Seed: Therefore the fermentation of this Grain by Malting is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107214:47"/> not an exaltation of its active Principles, as ſome would have it, but a diſſolution or relaxation of that viſcous matter that detains them, and puts a cheque or ſtop to its Vegetation, which would otherwiſe according to the Laws of Nature neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follow and exhauſt its <hi>Spirits;</hi> For common Water cannot be ſuppoſed to add much to the exaltation of the Spirit, or active Principles of Corn: Nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed can any thing add to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the high vertue that is in Seeds, but what containeth in it much of the <hi>Spiritus Mundi,</hi> or Univerſal Agent, As <hi>Nitrous Waters, Salts, Dungs,</hi> &amp;c. or their being ſown in freſh Land that is enriched with it; For Water is but a vehicle to convey ſuch Principles: Water and the Principles being not the ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>After the <hi>Barley</hi> is opened and its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getating property prevented by drying it; it is now thereby made capable of yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its <hi>Tincture</hi> or <hi>Vertue;</hi> For the Aquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity or Phlegme of any thing, eſpecially of a Vegetable, preventeth the extraction of its Tincture or Vertue: Therefore the drying of <hi>Hops, Wormwood, Broom,</hi> &amp;c. is not only done for the preſerving them,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:107214:48"/> but for that the Liquors wherein they are infuſed, do the better extract their Vertue; As thoſe that have infuſed the ſame in their <hi>Beer</hi> can witneſs. So Malt, whilſt it is green, will not make Ale or Beer of that ſtrength, as it will do when dried; And if it be but eaſily dried, the Ale will be paler than if it be throughly dried; and in caſe it be hard dried, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dried, the deeper will the Tincture of the <hi>Ale</hi> be: But ſuch over drying uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waſts the Spirits of the Malt, which are now looſe, and by this Art made Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile.</p>
                  <p>The Fermentation of the Meal of any <note place="margin">Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Meal.</note> Corn for Bread by Yeſt, Leaven or the like addition, openeth its Body and relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Viſcoſity that detaineth its Spirit, which is the cauſe that the Bread of ſuch a fermented Maſs is light, grateful to the Palate, eaſie of digeſtion, and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; and if not ſo fermented, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes in every point the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is that <hi>Ale</hi> or <hi>Beer</hi> made of <note place="margin">The cauſe of roapy and windy Drink.</note> Malt not throughly malted, or of ſuch, that part thereof is well malted, and part not, becomes <hi>Roapy,</hi> by having not
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107214:48"/> its Viſcoſity wholly taken away in the firſt operation, or made by adding Oaten Malt, or Oates mixed with other Malt, whereof is that Drink made which they call Oat<hi>-Ale;</hi> All which is unwholeſome, cauſing Obſtructions and great Windi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the narrow paſſages of the Blood in Humane Bodies.</p>
                  <p>The like doth Bread or any other matter made of Wheat unfermented, or that hath undergone ſome degree of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination before it hath been at the Mill, whereby a due fermentation is impeded. The reaſon of this my preſent diſcourſe on Malt, or fermentation of Corn or Grain, is not only to forewarn all good Husbandmen that they be cautious in eating or drinking any thing made of unfermented Corn or Grain, unleſs it be otherwiſe prepared, by due coction, or good additions, according to the Culi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Art. But alſo to excite ſuch that have <hi>Art, Skill</hi> and <hi>opportunity</hi> to make uſe of this Art of fermentation on ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other <hi>Grains, Seeds,</hi> &amp;c. for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting their ſpirits or better parts; ever varying the method of fermentation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the Grain or Seed to be fermented; for ſome Seeds
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107214:49"/> require much longer time to be imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, than doth <hi>Barley,</hi> ere their Viſcous matter be relaxed, and ſo nevertheleſs retain their Spirits even to Vegetation; as the Seeds of ſeveral Vegetables that have undergone all the operations that Barley hath done in Malting, yet will germinate and encreaſe when ſown, as if they had never been ſo ordered; the like will ſome Grains of Barley that have not been fully ripened; and all <hi>Barley</hi> doth require more or leſs time and skill to malt, it according to the different Seaſons: All which deſerve the enquiries into, and conſiderations of the Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                  <p>Note that the viſcous matter that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the Vegetable Spirit in all Seeds, being relaxed by Fermentation, ſuch Seed tumefy, and are thereby made more eaſie in parting with their Spirits. For Barley when it is malted, occupieth more room than it did before, although it be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed in its weight by the loſs of its duſt, (the <hi>Come:)</hi> And Meal when it is fermented for Bread, encreaſeth in Bulk; but without addition or diminution of its weight: So that fermentation is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a relaxation of thoſe Bonds
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107214:49"/> that preſerve the vegetating Seed for production, and that prohibit the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence or waſt of its Spirits till thoſe Bonds are relaxed or broken.</p>
                  <p>I have this to add to what hath been <note place="margin">Of Hemp and Flax.</note> already treated on concerning theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. To wit, That the Seeds of <hi>Hemp</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Benefit of Hemp-ſeed.</note> being ſo deſirable by Birds, and ſeeing that Pigeons in the Hemp-Countries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> &amp;c. are ſo large and fat. It may probably be a conſiderable addition to the Improvement of Lands by ſowing of Hemp, to convert the uſe of its Seed to the feeding of Poultry, and other Fowl; for it is a great Crop of Seed that an Acre of Hemp will yield, beſides the benefit of the Stalks.</p>
                  <p>And in caſe ſuch Seeds ſhould give the Fleſh of Fowl fatted therewith, ſome ill Taſt, as hath been reported, yet that would be ſoon altered by feeding the Fowl 2 or 3 days before they are killed with other Grain; for ſuch a Taſt or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour contracted by the Food, is ſoon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and made connatural by the heat of ſuch quick digeſters.</p>
                  <p>But the great Improvements that are to be made of Hemp and Flax, are by
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107214:50"/> converting the ſame into <hi>Linnen, Paper,</hi> or <hi>Cordage.</hi>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107214:52"/> on the lower ſo ſtrongly, that Hemp or Flax may (by being drawn through between them) be far better and eaſier broken or mollified than by the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Heckling. This <hi>Engine</hi> may be made with Handles at each end for 2 to turn; and then 4, 5 or 6 may feed it, and take it away on the other ſide to diſpoſe of it in order: And the work may be often repeated as there is cauſe. And the Spring every time harder depreſs'd by the Screw; that as in the common way the Flax is heckled three times, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very time in a finer Heckle, ſo here it may be every time harder wrought through the tooth'd Rolls, and often working it through the Rolls, will make it exceeding fine. An Ingenious Workman will ſoon make this an uſeful and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Machine,</hi> although at firſt it may not ſeem to be ſo; for any thing that is new requires patience with ſome damage to make it perfect; as every Mechanic that undertakes a new piece of Work can tell: Therefore this requires a willing, as well as an Ingenious Workman to make it compleat.</p>
                  <p>Another Objection is, that our Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen is not ſo white as foreign: Which is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107214:52"/> anſwered as the former; That often wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of it will make it whiter, as every Whitſter can tell: So that if Hemp or Flax be watered and beaten, it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the more ſubtile and white. It is obſerved that in the making of the fineſt Linnen beyond the Seas, ſeveral years are required for the preparing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the Flax to ſuch a fineneſs and whiteneſs; which here we deſpair of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, unleſs we can accelerate the ſame by the ſaid Engine; For if often waſhing of Linnen will make it white, and much beating and heckling it make it ſoft or ſubtile; Its very probable, that by watering or waſhing, and often work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in this <hi>Engine,</hi> it may be made ſoft, fine and white.</p>
                  <p>For the difference between corſe Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen and fine, ſeems to be in the ſoftneſs and fineneſs of the Hemp or Flax, (which is more eaſily ſpun into a ſmall Thread) and the whiteneſs of it, to which white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it ought to be reduced before it be Spun or Woven, elſe it will be very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultly whitened after, without prejudice to the Cloath if very fine: For we may obſerve that ordinary Linnen by often wearing, waſhing and hanging abroad in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107214:53"/> the Air, becomes ſoft and white, but with prejudice to the Cloath, becauſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not undergo thoſe ſeveral hardſhips with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſenſible loſs or decay.</p>
                  <p>It is obſerved that frequent waſhing and wearing of Linnen makes it the whiter and finer, and that in the waſhing, Aſhes of Wood, or other Vegetables are uſed, either in the Soap, or the Lixivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um or Lye, wherein ſuch Linnen is waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which very much conduces to its ſoftning and whitening, which is the true meaning of what <hi>Paracelſus</hi> affirms in the 7th Book of the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>things. That of Flax boiled in ſharp Lye, made of the Aſhes of Wood, is Silk made;</hi> That is to ſay, It is reduced to the fineneſs of Silk, and equal to it in price; for there is fine Linnen equal in value, weight for weight to Silk. It is the <hi>Alcali</hi> of Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, <note place="margin">Alcali.</note> or the Salts of their Aſhes that are of ſuch efficacy in this Work, for the Waters which the Whitſters uſe, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with the like matter, but in ſo ſmall a meaſure, that they operate but ſlowly: But in the elevation of Aſhes, thoſe of the <hi>Aſh, Beech,</hi> or other white Woods are to be preferr'd, becauſe ſome may probably caſt a yellowiſh colour, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantagious to Linnen.</p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:107214:53"/>
                  <p>The principal advantage to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that the making of Linnen here would be, is the prevention of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of foreign Linnen, ſome part whereof is already accompliſhed by our uſing ſo little in the burying of our dead; and in the more general wearing of <hi>Flannel Shirts,</hi> &amp;c. in ſtead of Linnen, being (by far) more pleaſant, healthy and cheap, as many of our Nobility, Gentry and Commons, can by many years expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teſtifie. It is alſo another great advantage that would redound to the Husbandman in the improvement of his Lands, by ſowing Hemp and Flax, and very neceſſary in the imployment of many People, in caſe there be any place where imployment is wanting.</p>
                  <p>The want of People, I know, is the main impediment to this great deſign of making our own Linnen; for in <hi>Derby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> the common People are imployed in the Summer-time in waſhing Lead-oar, and in the Winter, when the other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment fails, they fall to Spinning, Weaving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which makes our home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made Linnen ſo plentiful in thoſe parts: Therefore all ways ſhould be promoted that ſhorten the work, and leſſen the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107214:54"/> pains in dreſſing and fitting the Hemp and Flax fit for the <hi>Spinner;</hi> And if any way there be more nimbly to ſpin the Thread, and then to weave it with more expedition, the ſame ſhould be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and encouraged. There have been Looms or Engines made to weave ſeveral Ribbons at once, that is, by the ſame labour, and in the ſame time as they uſually weave one; and ſuch Engines have been broken by ſuch that had no farther proſpect than private intereſt, which makes the Relation of the <hi>Dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zick Invention</hi> more credible; It was, as is ſaid, a rare Invention for Weaving of 4 or 5 Webs at a time, without any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane help: It was an <hi>Automaton</hi> or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that moved of it ſelf, and would work night and day; (being as is to be ſuppoſed, kept in motion by Weights or Water.) It was ſupreſt, becauſe it would prejudice the poor People of the Town: And the Artificer made away ſecretly (as was conceived) as <hi>Lancellotti</hi> the <hi>Italian</hi> Abbat relates out of the mouth of Mr. <hi>Muller</hi> a <hi>Polonian,</hi> that he had ſeen the device.</p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:107214:54"/>
                  <p>Another uſe of Hemp and Flax, is for <note place="margin">Of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Paper.</note> the making of Paper. The firſt Material that was uſed to write on, as we read of, was Stone, on which the Law was written. The <hi>Sybils</hi> Books were ſaid to be written on Leaves of Trees; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Rinds of Trees ſerved for that uſe: And for many Ages was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paper uſed, than what was made of Reeds, which grew on the Banks of ſeveral Rivers, and plentifully on the Banks of the <hi>Nile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the modern Invention of Paper made of Linnen, ſurpaſſeth all in this kind, being ſo cloſe compacted, ſo white and durable, that it may be reckoned among the ſingularities of Art; And it is a vaſt quantity thereof that is daily uſed in this Kingdom, in Printing, Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That could it be made here, it would be of great advantage to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in particular to the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. There are two objections or diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that lie in the way; The one is, That there is not old Linnen enough in <hi>England</hi> to be eaſily had for that purpoſe; for Paper hath hitherto derived its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree from the Dunghil; and old Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107214:55"/> muſt come cheap to the Paper-mill, and Linnen being in <hi>England</hi> a dearer Commodity than Woollen, and the Country colder, Linnen is not ſo much worn, as in warmer places; and ſo not ſo many Rags or refuſe Linnen to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered for the Paper-mills: To remove which there ſhould be encouragement given to ſome ſmall Agents in Towns, to gather up and buy all refuſe fine Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen that can be had; As now in many places there is for corſe Linnen, and ends of Ropes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the making of Brown-paper.</p>
                  <p>And in caſe that deſign take of redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <hi>Flax</hi> to a certain degree of White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fineneſs, by the before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>Machine;</hi> there will be much Tow or refuſe Flax, that may by the Paper-mill Hammers be reduced to the ſame conſiſtence, as hard ſeamy Rags of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen-Cloath uſually are.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Objection is, That our Waters in <hi>England</hi> make not ſo white Paper as ſome foreign Waters do. For it is obſerv'd, that in <hi>France</hi> the whiteſt Paper is made but at ſome certain place, where the Water is more fit for it than elſewhere. In anſwer to which, There
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107214:55"/> are ſeveral Springs and Streams in this Kingdom that proceed from Chalk or rocky Mountains, that in the diſtilling leave a fine white reſidence in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, that may be as fit for this purpoſe as any foreign Water whatſoever. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Waters may be tryed in ſeveral places before the main work is begun. But this old Objection of want of good Water, is now become invalid: For ſince the French Mechanics have come over into <hi>England,</hi> they have proved the Water here to be equally as good as in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If Lands may be rented, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions <note place="margin">Of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Cordage.</note> for the Workmen may be had cheaper here than in other Countries; Then ſurely may <hi>Hemp</hi> be propagated, and Cordage made at eaſier rates, here than abroad; which being done, more might be exported, and leſs imported, to the great encouragement of <hi>Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Mechanic</hi> Arts. But an Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here is alſo raiſed by the <hi>Ropers, viz.</hi> That our Hemp is harder than foreign, and doth not work ſo fine, nor take Pitch ſo well, <hi>Quaere,</hi> whether much wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107214:56"/> may not abate its Viſcoſity, and make it more pliable.</p>

But the method now uſed by cutting or paring off the Turf with a Breaſt-Plow, is very laborious, tedious and coſtly, and ſometimes very hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous; By reaſon that in a dripping Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, this Work is much impeded, the Owner fruſtrated of his expectation of a great improvement; for that a great part of the Turf is not throughly burnt, and ſo becomes uſeleſs, and the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man much damnified, being at a great trouble in often turning his Turfs before
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:107214:56"/> he can apply his Fire; and then at the charge of Furze, or the like Ollet, to burn the Turf withal; And the uſual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in <hi>Denſhiring</hi> an Acre in a dry Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, when at beſt, is twenty Shillings, or more; which in a bad year the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage made by this Husbandry will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay, although in a good year it will double it.</p>
                  <p>To make <hi>Denſhiring</hi> therefore more <note place="margin">A Denſhir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Plough</note> eaſie and cheap: It is not difficult to make an Inſtrument to pare off the Turf as thin or thick as you pleaſe; That in ſtead of being forced forwards by more than ordinary humane ſtrength, it may be drawn by one or more Horſes, but not without the skil or labour of a good Workman to guide it: It muſt have two Wheels or Trundles; If they are low, then may your paring Plough reſt on the Axis; but if larger Wheels be found to be moſt proper, then may the paring Plough be fixed at ſome diſtance under the Axis; and either way it muſt have a long Stail or Handle, by which the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by elevating or depreſſing thereof, may cauſe the Turves to be pared thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or thicker as he pleaſes, and as the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:107214:57"/> unevenneſs of the ground requires, ſo may he thereby regulate the Work. And thus with one Horſe and two Men, may two Acres at leaſt be pared in a day, in caſe the ground be even or ſmooth; but if uneven, or full of Stumps or Hills, then it requires reiterated operations; yet may two ſuch Men and one Horſe, pare an Acre in a day; and the Work every whit as well done, as by the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Breaſt-Plough.</p>
                  <p>Thus may an Acre be denſhired for a fourth part of the expence, and in leſs than a fourth part of the time, than by the other way. And although there may be but little dry Weather together, yet may you do a great deal whilſt it laſts.</p>
                  <p>There can be no exception made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch an Inſtrument, nor difficulty ariſe in the uſe of it: But an ingenious and willing Artiſt, may by altering and amending it, as he finds the Error, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it, and make it practicable: For there is nothing that is newly invented, but may and uſually doth meet with rubs, and ſometimes not a few in the way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Artiſt brings it to perfection; But this is an Inſtrument ſo ſeaſible and

                  <p>MUch hath been written by divers <note place="margin">Preſerving of Woods, good Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry.</note> able Pens, in Commendation of Woods, as one of the principal general Improvements that can be made; Yet have ſome pretended that deſtruction of Woods in any place, would very much advantage the Trade of ſuch places; by reaſon that the want of Timber, Wood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for Mechanic Uſes, and for Fewel, would neceſſarily introduce Imployment for many, in bringing all ſuch materials, as muſt ſupply theſe defects that are occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the deſtruction of Woods, which may be true; as well as, that the Burning of any <hi>City, Town</hi> or <hi>Houſe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth imployment for ſeveral Mechanics. But what is this to the benefit or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the whole, which is ever to be weighed and conſidered of, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of any Improvement, Trade or
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107214:58"/> Imployment? For in caſe the Timber and Wood, that now ſerveth any City or Town, with Materials for Building; and for all ſorts of Mechanics that <hi>Work</hi> in Wood; as Joyners, Turners, Wheel-wrights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all poor and rich for Fewel, ſhould be ſo devaſted, that the Inhabitants of ſuch places, ſhould be conſtrained at an extraodinary expence to furniſh themſelves from abroad, with the like neceſſaries; although the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers of ſuch may in all probability gain very much thereby; yet every Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man muſt pay the more for what he hath occaſion for; And by the ſame Rule muſt raiſe the prices of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, that is made of it; and in time muſt remove himſelf to ſuch places where he may exerciſe his Trade at a cheaper rate.</p>
                  <p>To deſcend to particular Examples of places: The Greatneſs of the Famous City of <hi>London,</hi> may partly be imputed to the plenty and cheapneſs of Timber and Fewel; without which in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability it could never have encreaſed to that Magnitude.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:107214:59"/> many Towns ſtanding in the more Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion parts of the Kingdom, ſhew to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Traveller, that they are miſerable in reſpect of their Buildings, Trades, and Fewel. All which is ſum'd up in a few words, by the Pen of the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd Writer on this Subject, in his diſcourſe of Foreſt Trees: <hi>Since it is certain and demonſtrable,</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>That all Arts and Artiſans whatſoever, muſt fail and ceaſe, if there were no Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Wood in a Nation; (for he that ſhall take his Pen, and begin to ſet down what Art, Miſtery, or Trade, belonging any way to humane Life, could be maintain'd and exercis'd without Wood, will quickly find that I ſpeak no Paradox,) I ſay, when this ſhall be well conſidered, it will appear, that we had better be without Gold, than without Timber,</hi> Chap. 31.</p>
                  <p>It is not the defect of any Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity that makes a Trade, nor the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Proviſion; but the natural ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Place, the induſtry of the Inhabitants, and the plenty of Materials and Proviſions: For it is the plenty of Proviſions, and other Materials, with the induſtry of the Inhabitants, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the places, that contracted ſo
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107214:59"/> great a Trade to <hi>Barbadoes, Jamaica,</hi> &amp;c. and with that, great plenty of Mony; So that to ſay, <hi>Its better to live where your Dinner muſt coſt a Dollar; than where you may Dine for a Groat;</hi> is no argument that Proviſions are more ſcarce and dear, where your Dinner muſt coſt a <hi>Dollar,</hi> than where it may coſt but a <hi>Groat;</hi> but that there is more plenty of Mony: For in the moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Provinces or Places of <hi>Europe,</hi> is the greateſt plenty of Gold and Silver, which have been extracted out of the moſt ſterile Regions of the Earth. And by that plenty, are the rates and prizes of Commodities and Proviſions eſteem'd: As the rates and prizes in like manner have been in different Ages in this very Kingdom. For ſaith <hi>Stow, Anno</hi> 1288. A Quarter of Wheat was ſold in <hi>London,</hi> where it was deareſt, for 3 <hi>s.</hi> 4. <hi>d.</hi> in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places at 20 <hi>d.</hi> 16 <hi>d.</hi> 12 <hi>d.</hi> and in the Weſt and North at 8 <hi>d.</hi> the Quarter; when in our Age, ten times that price, is too cheap to maintain the Husbandman. The rates of Lands, prizes of Cattel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were much after the ſame rate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion: Not that there is now a greater ſcarcity of every thing, or a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:107214:60"/> of People. But the Subterranean Stores, have by the indefatigable Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of Man been opened, and their Treaſures diſſipated. And ſuch places that have been moſt fertile, and abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Woods, and other neceſſaries for Trade; well ſituated, and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly cultivated, have by the interchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of their Commodities, Proviſions, and Manufactures, drawn to them the Wealth of the Indies, and other foreign Nations: And by their encreaſing, and maintaining their Plantations of Timber, Woods, Corn, Fruits, and all other Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage; and encreaſing their Fleece-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flocks, and other Cattel; do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and encourage the ſame Trade. But ſhould they either neglect ſuch po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical and excellent Husbandry; or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof, deſtroy what Nature ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly produceth; inſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting Wealth from abroad, they may waſt their Treaſures in buying one of another, till they have nothing left to buy nor ſell. Like unto the Ten Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe-keepers, (that when their Trade was low) agreed to meet at one of their Houſes one day, and at another of their Houſes the next; and ſo round to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:107214:60"/> a Trade amongſt themſelves, which they did till they found their Drink all drank out, and neither of them a peny the richer.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary; There are many <note place="margin">Cutting of Woods at a due Seaſon good Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry.</note> Perſons in this Kingdom, that ſuffer their Woods to grow too long, which is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther profitable to themſelves, nor for the publick good. For when Timber or other Wood is at its full growth; it either ſtands at a ſtay, or ſenſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays, and ſome years before it hath done growing, it improves ſcarce one <hi>per Cent'.</hi> Such Perſons being poſſeſſed of an opinion, that it is ill Husbandry to cut down their Woods, (as too many have done) and conſidered not, that the Monies raiſed by ſuch Wood-falls would bring in a greater advantage to them, than the ſlow growth of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Woods can be expected to do, in caſe they are not yet at their full growth; and if they are, then they evidently loſe by their ſtanding. And the felling of ſuch well grown Woods, is alſo very advantagious to the publick: For it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth the Markets with neceſſaries, which otherwiſe muſt be ſupplied from
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:107214:61"/> foreign Parts; for the leſs of the growths of foreign Countries we import, for our exported Goods or Monies, the more of our Monies we ſave, or elſe have the more of their Coin or Bullion. The due felling of Woods doth likewiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an encreaſe of the ſame Species; witneſs the conſtant felling of Woods in <hi>Berk-ſhire,</hi> for the ſupply of many Mechanic Tradeſmen in <hi>London,</hi> with matter to work on; and a great part of the City with Fewel: And the like in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> for the ſupply of the Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works there. The gain ariſing from thence, encourageth the Owners of thoſe Woods to propagate and preſerve them; For in caſe any perſon hath (as I know ſome that have) an hundred Acres of Wood well grown, and ſhall every year fell five Acres of that Wood, until the whole be felled; always preſerving the ſame after felling; by that time the whole is felled, the firſt five Acres will be very well grown again; and the Owner in the mean time hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Revenue out of ſuch Woods, and the Markets the better furniſhed. A notable Example of this Husbandry, hath the <hi>moſt Worthy</hi> Mr. <hi>Evelin</hi> in his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107214:61"/> Diſcourſe of Foreſt Trees, given of <hi>the Lord</hi> Scudamore, <hi>his having in leſs than thirty years after the felling of a decayed Wood, neer a</hi> 1000 l. <hi>worth of Wood grown on the ſame Land, not of above the value of</hi> 8 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> per Annum. <hi>Chap.</hi> 34. So that the ill Husbandry is not in felling of Woods well grown, but in the not nouriſhing the growing Woods in the room of them. The ſame may be ſaid in felling of ſingle Trees in Hedgerowes. If ſuch Feller did but propagate three for every one he fells, as in <hi>Biſcay</hi> by the Law they are obliged to do. None need condemn ſuch for ill Husbands, nor ever dread a ſcarcity of this Material.</p>
                  <p>In many parts of the World, the <note place="margin">An eaſie way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radicate great Trees.</note> Woods are a great incumbrance, and hinder the tilling or improving their Lands. And in our foreign Plantations on the Weſtern Continent, one of the greateſt Expences they are at, is the cleanſing their Lands from thoſe cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Woods that annoy them there; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have but few Hands, and the Labour is great to extirpate them. And as I am informed, there is a Perſon that hath diſcovered a more eaſie way, than
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107214:62"/> hath been formerly made uſe of, for the eradication of great Trees; And hath obtain'd his Majeſties Letters, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, for the ſole uſe of the ſaid newly diſcovered Art, in ſome foreign Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And will (as is ſaid) undertake to cleanſe thoſe woody Grounds, at the rate of 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Tree, which is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in thoſe Countries. The manner of that operation I cannot learn: But this I offer as a very feaſible way to do the ſame thing; although perhaps it be not after the ſame method, which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus: Prepare two large Iron Hooks, with Loops to them; To each of theſe Hooks, faſten at the Loop a ſtrong, double or treble Block for a Pulley; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix one of theſe Hooks to the Tree you intend to eradicate: Then go to the next, or ſome other Tree at a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent diſtance, and affix the other Hook therto; and with a Cord duly applyed to theſe Pullies, may one, two or three Perſons (as ſtrength is required) ſo forcibly draw theſe two Trees together, that a ſmall help at the Root of the Tree deſign'd for a fall, will ſoon extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate it. The higher the Hooks are faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Trees, the eaſier will thoſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:107214:62"/> Trees bend to each other: If the Tree to be eradicated, be larger than that you make uſe of to aſſiſt the work; then place the Hook higher on that Tree, and the lower on the other. If the Trees be large you intend to fell, then let your Pullies be with three, four or more Rundles, and you need not queſtion but to maſter the greateſt Trees in the Woods, without any hard labour, or long time ſpent in doing it: And when they are down in ſuch places where their Wood is not valuable, their Aſhes may; for a good Fire will ſoon rid them out of the way.</p>

                  <p>WIthout Horſes, the Husbandry <note place="margin">Of Horſes.</note> of <hi>England</hi> would be of little Worth, the moſt laborious parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, being by them perform'd; No other Beaſt being ſo fit as theſe for the Plough, Cart, Travender-Waggons, Packſaddle, or grinding in the Mill: Therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good Husband ought to be very careful of his Horſes, to keep them Sound, and in good Heart; for on them depends much of his Proſperity.</p>
                  <p>And the great uſe that hath been made of the more generous and luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of theſe Beaſts, for the Saddle, Coach, Chariot, Raceing, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for War (for all which Uſes no other Beaſt is comparable to the Horſe) hath
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:107214:64"/> been very advantagious to the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, eſpecially to ſuch that have Lands proper, and take delight in propagating the beſt kinds; There being no greater profit to be made of paſturing Lands, than by breeding of good Horſes.</p>
                  <p>As to the uſes of <hi>Milk, Butter</hi> and <note place="margin">Of Cowes.</note> 
                     <hi>Cheeſe,</hi> they are ſuch, and ſo well known, that nothing can be more. I have only this to add, That as the various Soils, and the Herbage growing thereon, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce great variety of <hi>Butter</hi> and <hi>Cheeſe;</hi> although the Cowes and the Houſewifry too be the ſame: Yet it is moſt evident, that tradition and opinion have ſo far ſwayed with moſt Country-People, that here is the beſt <hi>Butter,</hi> and worſt <hi>Cheeſe;</hi> and there the beſt <hi>Cheeſe,</hi> and worſt <hi>Butter</hi> to be made; that therefore they will not be perſwaded in the leaſt, to alter their vulgar Method of making the one or the other; although of late years, ſome inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Huswives have inverted that Courſe, and made as good <hi>Cheeſe</hi> (where formerly the worſt only was made,) as hath been uſually made in ſuch places, that have been celebrated for good <hi>Cheeſe.</hi> The like hath been obſerv'd in making <hi>Butter:</hi> For
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107214:64"/> of the ſame Milk produced in any one ſort of Lands, are different ſorts of <hi>Butter</hi> or <hi>Cheeſe</hi> uſually made, meerly by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent method of the Houſewifry; as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one may obſerve, if they pleaſe. And although I pretend not to trouble the Reader, with the Art of making <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Cheeſe;</hi> nor to have any other inſight therein, than bare ſpeculation and hearſay; Yet I may from hence averre, that the Covetouſneſs in ſome, and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in others, is a great occaſion that bad <hi>Butter</hi> and <hi>Cheeſe</hi> are made of the ſame Milk; of which by good handling, very good may be had; for there is the ſame Philoſophy in theſe tranſmutations, as is in the fermentations of Beer and Bread: And all Men are ſenſible of the differences of the ſtrengths and taſts of thoſe things, meerly from the Mechanic operations.</p>
                  <p>For as I have heard, ſome out of a <note place="margin">To make the beſt Butter and Cheeſe.</note> greedineſs to have a great quantity of <hi>Butter,</hi> take off too much Milk with their <hi>Cream,</hi> which makes a poor hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry <hi>Butter,</hi> and a barren <hi>Cheeſe</hi> of the remainder; others of a better reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion take only the top Cream, with which
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107214:65"/> they make their beſt Butter, and with the remaining Milk they make the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Cheeſe. All that is to be wiſh'd, is that the good Houſewives underſtood more of this ſort of Philoſophy, and leſs wedded to Tradition and Humour; Then I am confident theſe Commodities would be very much improved. I will only here add a Receipt which I found in the <hi>Annotations</hi> on Mr. <hi>Samuel Hartlibs Legacy</hi> of <hi>Husbandry,</hi> how to make bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Butter than ordinary, without ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Milk for Cream, <hi>viz. The Milk ſo ſoon as it is come from the Cow, muſt be ſtrained, then Churn'd, as uſually Cream is done. Alſo the Cheeſe made of the Butter-Milk, will be better than the beſt two-meal Cheeſes that ever you did eat; And one pound of this Butter, ſhall be worth a pound and a half of your beſt But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is made of Cream;</hi> probatum <hi>by a Gentlewoman, a great Houſewife dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Iſle of</hi> Ely; which if it prove on trial what it promiſes, may be of great advantage. Its probable the great labour which will be required in ſo great an Agitation, hath deterr'd the always buiſie Houſewife from proſecuting the Experiment; but the rolling or tumbling
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107214:65"/> Churn, I ſuppoſe may effect it with much leſs labour than the upright.</p>
                  <p>It is uſual for Houſewives to ſet their <note place="margin">A new ſort of Milk Pans.</note> Milk to cream in broad earthen Pans, or wooden Treys, which take up much room, and are troubleſome in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; the deſign being to ſet their Milk as ſhallow as they can; it yielding the more Cream, or the ſooner, which is better. Therefore ſince the Art of making Lead into thin Lamins, Plates or Sheets, hath been diſcovered; I have ſeen broad and ſhallow Caſes of Board, made and lined in the inſide with this Lead, with a Tap-hole at the one Corner of each, and a Plug of Wood fitted to it. Theſe Caſes were about two Foot in breadth and length, and were placed the one by the other on a Bench; the Tap-hole hanging over, that the <hi>Milk</hi> after the <hi>Cream</hi> be ſcum'd off, may be let out thereat into a Pail, or elſe the Milk may be thereby drain'd greatly from the Cream; and then the Cream received by it ſelf, as the Houſewife pleaſes. Theſe Pans may be made greater or leſſer as the Dairy requires, and may be ſcalded as they ſtand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:107214:66"/> removing them; the Hole a little declining to the Tap-hole. Theſe Pans very much reſemble the Brewers Coolers, wherein they cool their Worts: Thus may improvements be made even in the ordinary Arts of Houſewifry, Cookery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It hath been found by long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <note place="margin">Of fatning of Cattel.</note> that the ſweeteſt Food, fatneth Cattel ſooneſt. Therefore the Paſtures that lie moſt open to the Sun, are more deſirable by all ſorts of Cattel, than the ſhady, the one being ſweet, and the other ſower. And <hi>Clover, Trefoil,</hi> &amp;c. more than common Graſs, from the ſame cauſe. And all ſorts of Cattel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Fat ſooner on theſe ſweeter Paſtures, than on the more ſower. Oates, the ſweeteſt of all Grain, are more deſirable by the Horſe, than any other, and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him ſooner. Barley made ſweet by malting, then ground and mixed with Milk, fatneth Fowl, eſpecially Geeſe ſooner than any unfermented Grain. Milk by reaſon of its innate ſweetneſs, nouriſheth and fatneth more than any ſimple thing whatſoever.</p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:107214:66"/>
                  <p>It is obſervable, that the leſs Milk any Beaſt gives, the ſweeter it is: Therefore <hi>Aſſes</hi> Milk is preferrable to <hi>Cowes</hi> Milk, and the Red Cowes Milk to the Black: <hi>Mares, Ewes, Sowes,</hi> &amp;c. give leſs Milk than <hi>Cowes;</hi> yet their <hi>Colts, Lambs, Pigs,</hi> &amp;c. grow faſter or fatter in proportion than <hi>Calves,</hi> and none of them will thrive ſo well with Cowes Milk, as with their own, by reaſon that Cowes give ſo great a quantity, and their Food only Graſs and Water; it cannot be ſuppoſed that their Milk ſhould be ſo Rich, as the Milk of thoſe that give leſs, or feed higher: Therefore ſome that have nurſed up young Pigs with Cowes Milk, have added Sugar to it; by which means, ſuch Pigs have grown much in a little time, and very Fat withal, very much to the advantage of their Feeders; and their Fleſh hath been extraodinary white and delicate, much more than if they had fed on Cowes Milk alone; neither would they have thrived ſo well, in caſe they had ſuckt their own Dam: Seeing then, that the ſweeteſt Foods conduce moſt to the nouriſhment and fatning of Cattel, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Swine;</hi> in the fatning of which
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107214:67"/> is the greateſt advantage to the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman; ſuch Foods are to be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the eaſieſt Rates: Amongſt which, <hi>Turnips</hi> are the beſt, which as they come raw from the Ground, may not anſwer the deſign: But in caſe they are boiled, and afterwards preſſed, they yield a ſweet and pleaſant Juice or Liquor: <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips</hi> (its known) may be raiſed in great quantities, at very eaſie Rates; and in a Furnace or large Kettle, many of them may be boiled together; theſe may be ground in the <hi>Roll-Cider-Mill,</hi> deſcribed in my <hi>Vinetum Britannicum,</hi> and there preſſed (as Apples uſually are for making of <hi>Cider:)</hi> In this expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Juice, may you add ground <hi>Malt, Barley, Oates,</hi> or the like; the ſweetneſs of this Liquor, with thoſe nouriſhing Grains in it, may without doubt fatten any Cattel, eſpecially Swine, ſooner and cheaper than their feeding on hard Corn can do, eſpecially in ſuch Years that Grain proves dear. If you boil your Turnips often in the ſame Liquor, that Liquor alſo will become ſweet.</p>
                  <p>For it is the liquid parts of any Roots that nouriſh; the Murc or refuſe when the Juice is preſſed out, addeth little to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107214:67"/> the nouriſhment of any Creature. And this expreſſed Juice here becomes a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle for the Meal that you mix with it, to digeſt and diſtribute it, according to the Law of Nature.</p>
                  <p>It may be objected, that Fat ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly raiſed, is not ſo firm as that which is cauſed from the Cattel, their feeding on harder Meat, which may be true: Yet if I can by this means raiſe my <hi>Cattel</hi> or <hi>Swine</hi> to a good degree of Fatneſs. I can for ſome reaſonable time after feed them with hard Meat, till their Fat is better digeſted, and made more firm.</p>

                  <p>Choice Seed well limed and ſown <note place="margin">To prevent ſmut in Wheat.</note> on good Land, that was not ſown with the ſame Grain the precedent Year, rarely produces ſmutty Corn: For ſmut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs is a degeneration of the Wheat; cauſed either by ſowing the ſame Land often with the ſame Species, or elſe with Seed that hath been taken from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Land, of the ſame nature with that on which it is ſown; or elſe by ſowing it on very poor Land, where the bulk of the Straw and Corn is raiſed, either by the force of Dung, or a drippy Summer, rather than from the natural ſtrength of the Land. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if your Land be fit for Wheat once in 2 or 3 years, buy your Seed from another Soil, and ſee that your change be proper, which the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of your Neighbours can beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you: For although you fetch it a great way, yet the large product will eaſily defray that expence: And let not your Land be ſown often with the ſame Grain. Then before you lime your Wheat, put it into a large Veſſel, fill it with Wheat about half full; then add ſo much Water as will quite
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107214:70"/> fill the Veſſel; then ſtir it well, and ſcum off all the light Corn, and ſo keep it ſtirring to the bottom of the Veſſel, till no more of the Wheat will ſwim, and them lime it: Thus do to all your Wheat that you ſow, and you will not have a ſmut-producing Seed left; for the light imperfect Corn, it is that produces the ſmut.</p>
                  <p>Great care is uſed in many places to <note place="margin">To mow or reek Wheat to prevent Mice.</note> build <hi>Reek-ſtavals,</hi> on which they Reek their Wheat to prevent the Mice, which otherwiſe would devour it: By which Vermin, Mows of Wheat in Barns are very ſubject to be devour'd: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent Mice from feeding on Wheat-Mows in Barns, after you have lain your Courſe of Straw to bed the Flower withal, ſtrew ſand round on the edges of the Bedding; then lay a Courſe of Sheaves, and on the ends of the Sheaves, at the outſide of the Mow, ſtrew more ſand, and ſo on every Courſe of Sheaves round the Mow to the very upmoſt Courſe; by which means it will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from the Mice: For when they endeavour to make their way into the Mow, the ſand (which will ſoon be
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107214:70"/> very dry) will fall into their Ears, and ſo torment them, that they will never attempt to come there again: This hath been many years uſed by an able Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, with the deſired ſucceſs, and without the leaſt inconvenience or da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to his Wheat, for the ſand will never mix with it.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Of Inſtruments, Tools and Engines, incident to this Profeſſion of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griculture.</head>
                  <p>THe moſt principal Inſtrument uſed in Husbandry is the <hi>Plough,</hi> and as it is, ſo have ingenious Men contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo many ways to make them more uſeful, and leſs toilſome; that there is more variety of <hi>Ploughs</hi> in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, than of any other <hi>Machine</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. But that which I am now to add to my former Treatiſe of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is, That there are divers new ſorts of Ploughs invented, and endeavoured to be brought into uſe, ſince my pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the former Tract: As the <hi>Steel-Plough,</hi> a Model whereof was (not long <note place="margin">Of the Steel-Plough.</note> ſince) curiouſly made by one Mr. <hi>Thomas</hi>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:107214:72"/> 
                     <hi>Llewellin,</hi> at the <hi>George</hi> in <hi>Catteaten-ſtreet</hi> in <hi>London;</hi> wherewith he pretended, that with one Man and two Horſes, or one Man and two Oxen only, might be plowed any ſort of Land whatſoever, as would not be performed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Ploughs, with leſs than double the Men and Cattel, which he offered as an infallible and unmatchable improvement. I have ſeen the Model, and it was well made; and without queſtion ſuch a Plough will far exceed the uſual Ploughs, by reaſon that a well made, true and clean Inſtrument of any kind or ſort whatſoever, will perform its Work for which it is intended, better than an ill ſhapen, falſe and rough can do. A Coach, Charriot, or Waggon, made high and true, will be drawn much eaſier than one that's groſs, and ill made. The Cutting parts of the Plough, alſo being made of well temper'd Steel, and keen, abate a great part of the ſtrength required in the Draught, as a ſharp Ax or Saw, will more eaſily break a Tree, than one that's dull. I know it will be objected that Steel is much deerer than Iron: To which I anſwer, That in caſe a Plough coſt 20 or 40 <hi>s.</hi> extroadinary in the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107214:72"/> Steel and Workmanſhip, it will ſoon be repayed, if 1 or 2 <hi>s. per diem</hi> can be ſaved (as no doubt but it will) in the uſe of it; beſides the advantage of time, which is of more worth at ſome ſeaſons, than all the extraordinary expence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to. As for the other more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal advantages of this Plough, with the deſcription of the Plough it ſelf, I refer you to the Author Mr. <hi>Llewellin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is another ſort of Plough <note place="margin">Of the French Ploughs.</note> brought into uſe by ſome French Men, (as I take it) which is very much like the double Plough deſcribed by Mr. <hi>Blith</hi> in his <hi>33th</hi> Chapter of his <hi>Englands</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, which will carry two Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows at once: As for the deſcription, uſe, and advantages of this double Plough, I refer you to the <hi>Monthly Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of Letters, of Husbandry and Trade,</hi> Collected and Publiſhed by that publique, ſpirited and ingenious Mr. <hi>John Haughton, Fellow of the Roial Society,</hi> where it is at large deſcribed, with its uſes and advantages.</p>
                  <p>In light Grounds it is uſual for ſix or <note place="margin">The deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of a Trenching Plough.</note> more labouring Men to follow the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107214:73"/> Plough at ſome diſtance; each taking ſome proportion with their Spades to caſt up the Earth from the bottom of the Furrow, on that which was turned over by the Plough; ſo that an Acre of Ground may thus be Plough-trenched in a day, as well as if the ſame had had been wholly done by hand; the Plough going before, and turning in the Sward or Turf; and the Spades coming after and covering it with light Earth, makes it capable or fit for various ſorts of Tillage to be planted in it: This way ſaves a great part of the charge of Trenching altogether by the Spade.</p>
                  <p>But an eaſier and cheaper way may yet be found to Plough-trench Land, without any help of the Spade; which is by making a Plough that ſhall under-cut the Earth, and caſt it over, inſtead of the uſual way of plowing: For in the uſual way, the Plough is made pointing, and is forced under the Sward, and by the ſpreading of the Plough, and help of the turning Board, the Earth is forced from wards, which requireth much greater ſtrength, than if the Plough were made of a proportionable breadth from the the point of the Share, to its hinder
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107214:73"/> part, and the Earth or Sward carryed from the bottom, and a turning Board caſt fromward; and then you may add either a ſecond Coulter and Share, to ſucceed the former (fixt to the ſame Beam) about four or five Inches lower, which ſecond Coulter and Share will cut and take up another courſe in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Trench, and carry it higher, and then the turning Board will throw it on the firſt Plowing; or elſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Plough may be made to caſt higher than the firſt to follow it: Each of theſe Ploughs may be drawn with half the ſtrength of the common forcing Plough, becauſe it cuts, raiſes, and caſts over the Earth without any ſide-forcing.</p>
                  <p>This Plough may be made five, ſix or ſeven Inches broad or more, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the nature of the ground, and ſtrength you intend to uſe, whether one, two or three Horſes to draw it; and will not only ſerve to plough, and Plough-trench Land; but alſo to pare off the Turf of ancient Paſture Land, in order to the burning of it; for the Foot on which the fore-end of the Beam reſts, may be made to ſtand higher or lower as you pleaſe; that it may cut thinner
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:107214:74"/> or thicker, and being as broad, will do that work as well as the breaſt Plough, and with five-fold more expedition.</p>
                  <p>The Ingenious may ſoon make perfect this deſign, and bring it into uſe: I have made a Model which anſwers what I have propoſed; and had I an aſſiſtant, ſhould ſoon bring it to perfection: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever theſe hints are ſufficient to them, that truly underſtand the uſe of the Plough.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE TO THE Second Part OF Vinetum Britannicum.</head>
                  <p>HAving formerly given you an account of moſt of the principal Things relating to the making of <hi>Cider,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our <hi>Britiſh Drinks</hi> in a
<pb facs="tcp:107214:76"/> plain and ſhort Method, that it might ſuit with the Capacities of thoſe that are uſually imployed in thoſe Rural Exerciſes: There now remains ſome few <hi>Obſervations</hi> and <hi>Experiments,</hi> which may ſerve as a ſupplement to that Treatiſe for a farther improvement of theſe Curious Liquors, (eſpecially <hi>Cider)</hi> and may probably be a help to thoſe that imploy themſelves ſometimes in endeavouring their Meliora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Many have attempted to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, but for want of a right apprehenſion of their Natures, have been fruſtrated of their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And when they have been miſtaken in the cauſe of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in making theſe <hi>Liquors,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of rectifying, have made them worſe; That when they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb facs="tcp:107214:76"/> made a Veſſel of <hi>Good Cider,</hi> it may be rather imputed to chance than skill. So that the moſt Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious made many years Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before they could rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the natural and moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Method of making it: For ſince the publiſhing of the former Part of the Treatiſe of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the experience of ſeveral Years, hath not only given me cauſe to correct ſeveral Miſtakes in my former; but capacitated me to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe in the Second Part a <hi>New Method</hi> of making the beſt <hi>Cider</hi> that <hi>Apples</hi> are capable to yield; Beſides many other very neceſſary <hi>Obſervations</hi> and <hi>Experiments</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the ſeveral Matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore treated of.</p>
                  <p>In this Second Part I hope to remove ſuch <hi>Remora's</hi> that have
<pb facs="tcp:107214:77"/> been laid in the way, by great Pretenders, whoſe authority in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this Nature, have wrought ſo far on very many Ingenious (though credulous) Operators on this Subject; that after many trials they failing of their deſired ſucceſs, it hath cauſed them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of obtaining that certain way of making <hi>Good Cider,</hi> ſo ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly plainly by them ſet forth; whoſe Aphoriſms and Rules (had they proved always true) had doubtleſs raiſed this Liquor into a great deal higher Reputation, than now it is amongſt the numerous Planters, which have been, and are very much increaſed by the confidence they have put in what they have read and heard, and the Encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agements they have received from thoſe that have ſometimes hit the
<pb facs="tcp:107214:77"/> Mark: Wherefore to undeceive and gratifie the Curious, and ſuch that are willing to promote ſo good a Work, as the Improvement of ſo great a part of our Engliſh Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, and to better inform thoſe that ſpend ſo much time, pains and expence in fruitleſs Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and in compounding and corrupting, inſtead of meliorating <hi>ill made Cider;</hi> I ſhall herein diſcover the true Nature of this Liquor, and the right Method of making it cheap and eaſie to the Operator, <hi>delightful</hi> to the <hi>Eye, pleaſant</hi> to the <hi>Palate, grateful</hi> to the <hi>Stomack, healthful</hi> to the <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>durable</hi> to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the <hi>Good Houſe-keeper,</hi> who may have of it in its purity and primitive Sweetneſs, not only throughout the Year, but for many Years after it is made.</p>

                  <p>IN the firſt Part of this Treatiſe, I have given an account of ſuch Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects or Materials, out of which Drinks or Liquors are extracted or prepared: As of the Sap of ſeveral ſorts of Trees therein mentioned; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of the Birch Tree, the Sap whereof hath been in great eſteem, not only for its Pleaſantneſs, but its ſingular medicinal Vertues. It hath been alſo <note place="margin">Sap of Trees.</note> obſerved, that the Sap of the <hi>Sicamor,</hi> is a very clear and ſweet Liquor; And that ſeveral other Trees yield plenty of <hi>Sap,</hi> which far exceeds common Water, either for the making of <hi>Mead</hi> or <hi>Ale.</hi> The <hi>Vine,</hi> if planted for no other uſe, would certainly by cutting the Branches in the Spring, yield a great quantity of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:107214:81"/> delicate Liquor. The Saps of the <hi>Elder, Elm, Oak,</hi> &amp;c. are well eſteem'd for their Medicinal Vertues. The Walnut Tree, and the Bramble, yield plenty of Liquor by cutting, which doubtleſs are not without their Specific Virtues.</p>
                  <p>Of late it hath been proved that <note place="margin">Juices of Fruits and Berries.</note> 
                     <hi>Quinces</hi> yield a delicate Wine, ſurpaſſing moſt Drinks: <hi>Peaches</hi> alſo and <hi>Apricocks,</hi> by ſome are made to yield pleaſant Wines. Of the Whortle-Berries that grow on the ſmalleſt of Shrubs, is made a very fine and pleaſant Drink.</p>
                  <p>Some have preſſed a Juice out of <note place="margin">Of Roots.</note> contuſed <hi>Carrots,</hi> and found the ſame to be a pleaſant, ſweet Liquor; but this hath need of ſome farther enquiry into, and experiment to be made of it.</p>

A learned Author of late in his praiſe of Wine, attributeth theſe virtues or <note place="margin">The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Wine.</note> qualities to it, <hi>viz.</hi> That it nouriſheth more than any other Aliment; That it corroborateth human Strength; That it openeth Obſtructions, and comforts and exhilerateth the Spirits: That the uſe of it in all tempers, is moſt <hi>Natural Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:107214:82"/> and in all Diſtempers, as proper <hi>Medicament.</hi> The nature and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of this <hi>Nectar,</hi> was ſo high in the Opinion of <hi>Noah,</hi> that he made it his firſt Art of Husbandry after the Deluge, to plant a <hi>Vineyard;</hi> The vertue and moderate uſe of the <hi>Juice</hi> whereof, may be ſuppoſed to be the cauſe why his Age extended twenty years above the Age of <hi>Adam;</hi> and three hundred and fifty years after the Plantation of his Vineyard. Drinks extracted out of Grain, and other compounded Drinks being then not in uſe; nor hath the uſe of them, ſince their Invention ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred their Drinks ſo Healthy and Long-lived, as the <hi>Spirituous Juices</hi> of ſeveral <hi>Fruits,</hi> eſpecially of the <hi>Vine</hi> and the <hi>Apple-Tree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe theſe Wines that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with theſe Vertues, muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from the places of their native growth; and do ſuffer ſo ſenſible a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of their excellency in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, that they may be compared to the <hi>Drugs,</hi> tranſported from <hi>Cochin-China</hi> to <hi>Italy</hi> by <hi>Barri</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> which as he relateth were ſo altered in their Tranſportation, that without a ſpecial
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:107214:82"/> Script upon them, he could not have known them to be the ſame, either in Vertue or Colour: And certainly theſe Liquors muſt much more ſuffer, than thoſe more ſolid Materials; The fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Fermentations, Boilings, Frettings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of theſe, in their being moved and tumbled from place to place, and through divers Climates ſubjected to the variety of <hi>Airs,</hi> cauſing an expence of their more ſpiritual and better parts; and a precipitation of their more ſolid and delicious, which are the moſt nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive; ſo that in effect we have but the Phlegmatic Part deprived of its principal Vertues; And that part too, oftentimes corrupted with the <hi>Coopers</hi> or <hi>Vintners</hi> Art, to make it pallatable and durable, that it becomes ungrateful to Nature, and injurious to Health and long Life, which evidently confirms our next Poſition.</p>

                  <p>THat <hi>Cider</hi> hath been of ancient Uſe in this Kingdom, and that <note place="margin">The Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Cider.</note> the name of Wine was attributed to it, I have lately met with a farther Confirmation in a ſmall Tract, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled <hi>Fragmenta Antiquitatis,</hi> being <hi>Ancient Tenures</hi> of <hi>Land,</hi> publiſhed by <hi>T. B.</hi> of the <hi>Inner-Temple</hi> Eſquire, <hi>Anno</hi> 1679.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:107214:83"/> was eſteemed one of the beſt of Apples, and yielded one of the moſt delicious of <hi>Ciders.</hi> And its probable that as foreign Wines became here more in uſe, that Husbandry of propagating Rermains decayed, the Trees being ſlow of Growth, and ſmall Bearers, which might probably be the cauſe why this Wine was reſerved to the Kings uſe, more than that of any other Fruit; it being more rare and delicious.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of the beſt and moſt expeditious ways of propagating the ſeveral ſorts of Fruit-Trees.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>AS Fruit-Trees, ſome of them do <note place="margin">Change of Plants an Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> effect one ſort of Land, and ſome another; and that Judgment is required for the placing of theſe Trees in their proper Soils wherein they moſt delight: So do ſome Species of Trees, grow weary of the Soil wherein they have been long planted, and do after ſome time degenerate, as ſeveral ſorts of Grain do, when often ſown in, or near the ſame place; and ſome Plants do the ſame, if planted often on the ſame or the like Ground: The uſual remedy in ſuch caſes, hath been to change the Seed, fetching it a far off; and by procuring other Plants from another Soil; as in <hi>Wheat, Strawberies, &amp;c.</hi> is generally obſerved. After the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:107214:84"/> ſame manner, in caſe it be obſerv'd that Trees that have been planted and propagated in a Soil wherein they have delighted, do by frequent graffing and raiſing of the ſame Species in the ſame Soil, degenerate. Your ſureſt remedy then will be to procure Graffs or Plants of the ſame Fruits from another Soil; as formerly the Graffs of the <hi>Kentiſh Pepin</hi> were brought out of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and it proving to be a good change of Soil, they proſpered exceedingly for many years; yet now it is obſerv'd that the Trees are more ſubject to the Canker, and proſper not ſo well, nor is the Fruit ſo good as formerly it hath been; Therefore have ſome ingenious Men, either already obtain'd, or ſhortly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to procure freſh <hi>Graffs</hi> from <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi> to renew that Kind, not queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning the ſucceſs to anſwer their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations.</p>
                  <p>It is obſerv'd that <hi>Horſes, Sheep, &amp;c.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Brackiſh Land good for Fruit.</note> thrive beſt on Marſhes that lye near the Sea, uſually called the Salt Marſhes, by reaſon of their Brackiſhneſs. <hi>Bees, Pigeons, &amp;c.</hi> thrive beſt alſo where they can come at the Salt and Freſh-water:
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:107214:85"/> Fiſh are very much improved in a Brackiſh Water: So are many Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles likewiſe; and in particular <hi>Apples</hi> growing on brackiſh Grounds near the Sea, yield a more rich and vinous <hi>Cider,</hi> than thoſe that grow more remote; and thoſe the pooreſt of all <hi>Ciders</hi> that grow on ſandy Lands, which attract moſt of their juicy Subſtance from the Rains, although they are all of one Species. The Trees on ſuch barren Lands, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plenty of Fruit in wet Summers, and few in dry, for want of that Nouriſhment which rich Lands furniſh the Trees withal: Therefore thoſe that have Lands lying well near the Sea, may promiſe themſelves better <hi>Cider,</hi> than thoſe more remote.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs Land newly recovered <note place="margin">Newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered Lands not good for Fruit. Their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</note> from the Sea, whilſt the Salt remains too much in it, is not good for Apples: But if it be caſt in ſmall Hills that the Rains may waſh the Salt from it, and this labour often reitrated until the Soil be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately ſweetned, and the Trees planted ſhallow in it; queſtionleſs they will then thrive, and if you can bring them to grow, you need not doubt the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:107214:85"/> of their Fruit and Liquor; And a better help to ſuch Lands cannot be than a mixture of ſweet Earth, fetched from above the taint of the Salt-Water, with your Salt Land: Nor can you better improve the poor ſandy Orchards, than by laying near the Roots of your Trees, Salt Clays or Earths, or other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Matters in caſe the Sea be near.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the <hi>Codlin</hi> and <hi>Gennet-Moil;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Sweet Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples raiſed of Cions.</note> there are ſeveral <hi>Sweet-Apples</hi> that may be propagated by <hi>Cions, Slips</hi> or <hi>Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,</hi> whoſe uſe in mixing with other Fruit in making <hi>Cider,</hi> ſhall hereafter in this Second Part be trated of. The raiſing whereof is the more to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, by reaſon the way is eaſie, and the Fruit coming to maturity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time of the <hi>Redſtreak,</hi> becomes very uſeful in mixing with them as hereafter is ſhewn: There is an other curious <hi>Cider-Fruit,</hi> that may be eaſily raiſed by the ſame Method as <hi>Codlins,</hi> which by meer accident I have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; but I cannot give you the Name of it, unleſs it be that which is uſually called the Spice Apple, being to me a new Species, and came among my <hi>Codlin-Slips</hi> by accident.</p>

                  <p>Such hath been the ſcrutinous Nature <note place="margin">The Quince a Vinous Fruit.</note> of Man, that he hath ſcarce left any Fruit unattempted, to extract its Blood for his uſe or delight: For the <hi>Quince,</hi> an auſtere Fruit, and of ill Savour, hath been found by expreſſion to have yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a very excellent Wine. Therefore in moiſt and rich Lands, the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating of Quince-Trees ought to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged: Its ſaid, that in that part of the <hi>Weſtern Continent</hi> now called <hi>Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,</hi> there grow ſuch vaſt quantities of this Fruit, that they make very much of its Wine.</p>
                  <p>In the Heathy Parts of <hi>Surrey, Hamp-Shire,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Whortle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries yield Wine.</note> 
                     <hi>Suſſex, &amp;c.</hi> grow great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Whortleberries, uſually called Whorts or Bilberries, of which is made a Wine inferiour to none of all the Artificial Drinks, that are extracted out of Fruits, being delicately taſted, and of an excellent Colour.</p>
                  <p>If your Ground be ſhallow, either <note place="margin">Planting Trees on ſhallow Land.</note> Sandy, Chalky, or Stony, Plant your Trees near the Surface, and lay ſtore of Mold or Earth about them, for
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:107214:86"/> about five or ſix Foot round the Tree, that they may ſeem to be planted Deep; that they may well be defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Drought, and the Roots will naturally incline downwards, and the Trees thrive as if planted on a deeper Soil.</p>
                  <p>Many have attempted to raiſe Vines <note place="margin">The moſt probable way to raiſe a Vinyard.</note> after the manner of the French in Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and have had good ſucceſs in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them; but the Fruits (however the Vinyard hath been poſited or ſituate) have not anſwered the Planters expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, not being ſo mature as thoſe that are planted againſt Houſes, Walls, or the like; by reaſon that the Air moving too and fro, inceſſantly refri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerates the Vine in the Spring, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting its early Budding in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the early Blowing of the Grape; And in the Autumn, the ripening of the Cluſters; ſo that let the Vineyard be planted againſt any South declining place; yet the cool Air moves through the open interſpaces of the Vines, and Leaves, that rarely our Summers are hot enough to qualifie it without ſomewhat of Art to be uſed. Therefore if thin,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:107214:87"/> low Walls of Brick, or the like, of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three or four Foot high, were built the length of the Vinyard from Eaſt to Weſt at a convenient diſtance, that they may not ſhade each other; and the Vines planted againſt them, at the ſame diſtance and height as in Vinyards; it would not only break the cool Breezes, but add to the heat of the Sun; eſpecially if the Ground before them be kept bare: But leſt this way may be too chargeable where Bricks are dear, it may be much cheaper to drive in a ſtrong Stake, or two ſlender Stakes at the back of each Vine, of about four Foot high above the Ground, to which about the time the Vine begins to ſpring, you may add a thin Board of about twelve Inches broad, or two Boards fixed together, making about eighteen Inches broad; againſt which you may tack your Vines and prune them, as in the firſt part of this Treatiſe is directed, only you need not turn them Archwiſe. Theſe Boards will break the Winds, and keep the Grapes warm after the Sun hath left them: Then after your Vintage is over, you may lay the Boards on heaps to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:107214:87"/> keep them from Rotting till the Spring: The Stakes may ſtand for many years if they are of Oaken Spine: The charge and trouble will not be great, if you conſider that your arched Props ſoon decay, and the conſtant annual Charge and Trouble the Planters of Hops are at, in renewing their Poles, and preſerving them in the Winter; much greater than this can be in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing theſe Boards, which lie in a little room, and endure many years ere they decay.</p>
                  <p>If your Ground be ſo fertile, that your Vines grow too rank, and Weeds encreaſe too faſt; then may you lay Sand near, and before your Vines, thick enough to ſuppreſs the Weeds, which will very much add to the heat of the Summers Sun, and thereby acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate the maturation of your Grapes; and alſo abate the too great fertility which much of our Engliſh Soil is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to; for the meaneſt dry and warm Land (ſo that it be not barren) is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for a Vinyard: <hi>Bacchus amat colles.</hi>

                  <p>Many of our beſt Fruit-bearing Trees, are ſubject to that pernicious Diſeaſe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:107214:88"/> the <hi>Canker,</hi> which in many places de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the whole Tree; And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Cuttings, Parings and Plaiſtrings that can be uſed, yet every new Shoot will be tainted with this Diſeaſe, as it hath happened to me in many of my beſt Fruits; and more particularly in one Tree that I moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, which the Canker had yearly ſo defaced, that for eleven Years together I had cut and pared its Wounds, that it was little the bigger in its growth, and had in all that time born only four Apples. In <hi>February</hi> 1682, I was willing to try ſome new experiment towards the Cure of that Diſeaſe; and having conſidered that the Land it grew on, was rich and light; and that in many places I had obſerved Trees to flouriſh in Courts and Yards, where the Soil was of the ſame Nature, and the Ground pitch'd or pav'd with Stone; I therefore cauſed the Earth to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away round my little, but diſeaſy Tree, about four Foot from the Stem, and about five or ſix Inches deep, and in the room thereof cauſed Stones to be ſet very cloſe and near together in Dirt taken out of the High-ways in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:107214:88"/> of Sand, after the ſame manner as Yards or Streets are paved.</p>
                  <p>The Tree thus paved round, in the Summer following emitted many fair Shoots; and in Autumn 1683, yielded above fourſcore fair well grown Apples, and increaſed in clean Branches, more than it had done in ſeven Years before, without the leaſt touch of its old Diſeaſe, and moſt of the old Sores were alſo skinned over, having firſt a little cleanſed them. In the Year 1684, this Tree continued in its flouriſhing and healthy Condition, encreaſing as before in its Branches; that to check its too great aſpiring and ſpreading, I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily forced to cut off the Tops of many of the new Shoots: Its Branches were alſo ſo laden with Fruit, that to preſerve them and the Tree, I cauſed Props to be ſet to ſupport ſeveral of them; which ſtrange effects were ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, and conſpicuous to many, that knew the former ſtate, and after ſaw the amended condition of the Tree; that they were ſufficiently convinced, that the laying of thoſe Stones were the very cauſe of the cure; and I am the more ſatisfied in my Opinion that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:107214:89"/> it was ſo: For that in the Year 1684, in the ſame manner I abated Earth from ſeveral other Trees infected with the like Diſeaſe, and applied (for cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake) a proportionable quantity of Chalk, and ram'd it faſt about the Trees, which hath produced near the like ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as was from the paving with Stone; but I as yet queſtion whether it will have that duration as Stone, ſo as to continue ſolid, it being apt to diſſolve, and degenerate into Earth.</p>
                  <p>For it is the depreſſion or detention of the <hi>Spiritus Mundi,</hi> or the true fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilizing Spirit in the Earth, about the Roots of the Tree, that thoſe Roots may the more plentifully attract it; and the prevention of other Vegetables from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting and waſting it, that is one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cauſe of the proſperity, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of the Tree ſo paved about: For the more of this true nitrous and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getating Spirit there is, and the leſs of the Crude and common Water, the more fertile and healthy will the Tree be. This Experiment I hope will be of general uſe and queſtion; not but it will ſucceed in moſt places where this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is common.</p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:107214:89"/>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, after all this care, there will remain ſome Fragments of the old Diſeaſe, it being ſo confirmed in the ſtock, that it will never be clean out of the Branch; like unto the <hi>Lues Venerea</hi> in ſome Annimals: For if a Tree be infected with this Diſeaſe the Canker, although you graff a ſound Graff of another Fruit on the ſtock, and leave but a few Inches of the Cankery Tree above the old ſtock, that ſmall part ſhall infect the new Graff, and all its Shoots: But however this Method of mine hath had much greater effects in the Cure of that Diſeaſe, and is more certain than any other yet pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly known: And the ſame Tree I ſo cured, continues in a very flouriſhing condition to this preſent Year 1688.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>NOtwithſtanding many have been ſo fortunate as to have a fair Plantation of Fruit-Trees, and thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo very fruitful; yet have they not had <hi>Good Cider,</hi> (unleſs ſometimes by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident) either for that they have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered their Fruit before it hath attained its due maturity, for the Juices of Fruits are beſt improved in their own proper Veſſels, (their skins) as Grapes the <hi>Vigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> of all foreign <hi>Vinyards,</hi> let them hang on the Trees till the ſtalks begin to ſtrivel next the Branch, that being a ſign that the Fruit receives no more nouriſhment from the Tree: And in the <hi>Canaries</hi> whence our beſt Wines come, they let them hang longer. Likewiſe <hi>Normandy Cider</hi> is generally ſweeter and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107214:90"/> better coloured than the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the through maturity of the Fruit. Therefore it is beſt here to let your <note place="margin">Time for gathering Apples.</note> Apples hang as long as conveniently they can: For when they begin to drop naturally, its a ſign they receive no more nouriſhment from the Tree; or if their Kernels be black, their colour change, or their ſcent be high, they may be ripe enough to gather: But <hi>Deux-Ans</hi> and other hard Fruit, may be gathered in a dry time, in <hi>October,</hi> leſt the Froſts im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair them: Notwithſtanding they have not thoſe ſigns of maturity, that other more early Fruit uſually have.</p>
                  <p>Some <hi>Apples</hi> retain a white colour till they are through ripe, as the <hi>White Beling, White Wine Apple,</hi> ſome ſorts of <hi>Pepins, &amp;c.</hi> ſome alſo are yellow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are through ripe, as the <hi>Orenge-Apple, Golden-Pepin, Kirton-Pepin,</hi> &amp;c. their ſcent doth not always indicate the time of their maturity, ſeveral Winter or late ripe <hi>Apples</hi> not obtaining ſuch ſcent or fragrancy, until they have lain ſome time on Heaps, or in large Veſſels, where they perfect their maturity by their acquired heat, more than they could do on the Trees.</p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:107214:91"/>
                  <p>The beſt way therefore is after your <note place="margin">Laying them on Heaps.</note> 
                     <hi>Apples</hi> are gathered off the Trees, to lay them on Heaps, or put them in large Veſſels in a dry place, and let them there remain two or three Weeks, more or leſs as the <hi>Apples</hi> are in maturity, which concocteth their Juice, and very much improveth it, and waſheth the more phlegmatic parts of the Fruit by ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and alſo (by a degree of putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction) weakneth the <hi>Branchery</hi> or <hi>Veins</hi> that unite the <hi>Parenchymous</hi> parts of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> eſpecially the more tough ſort of <hi>Deux-Ans, Weſtbury Apples, Leather-Coats, Oaken-Pins,</hi> &amp;c. making them to be more eaſily broken in the Mill, and more freely yield their Juices: For theſe tough and harder ſort of Fruits ought to lie till the end of <hi>November,</hi> or till <hi>December,</hi> before their Juices be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mature, and their <hi>Parenchymous</hi> parts made ſoluble; and then will theſe Fruits yield you the <hi>fineſt, ſtrongeſt</hi> and moſt <hi>ſpirituous Cider</hi> of any other: Their <hi>Juices</hi> having been longer from their firſt formation on the Tree, to their diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Mill, in a continued ſtate of digeſtion and conction, than other ſofter Fruit.</p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:107214:91"/>
                  <p>It is alſo obſervable, that the more difficultly Apples part with their Liquor in the Preſs, the thinner it is, the ſooner it becomes fine, and the more it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth in <hi>beauty, colour,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength:</hi> Therefore <hi>Apples</hi> eaſily yielding great quantities of Liquor are not always to be deſired, by thoſe that affect the beſt <hi>Cider.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some have pretended an indifferency, <note place="margin">Apples o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ripe or rotten, make no good Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> whether their Apples have been rotten or not, ſuppoſing that their <hi>Cider</hi> made of Fruits part ſound and part rotten, is of equal goodneſs to that which is made of all ſound Fruit; and others have eſteem'd that made of rotten Fruit only, to be the beſt. But neither of theſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ever made any very good of ſound Fruit, for it they had, they would without doubt have altered their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For Apples having lain over-long on heaps till they are pulpy, and part rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, will yield a thick Juice from the Preſs, difficult to be ſeparated from the <hi>Murc,</hi> which will be long before it be fine, and much of it will be waſted by reaſon of the great quantity of the pulp of the Apple that will be preſſed out
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:107214:92"/> with it, and muſt be ſeparated from it. And then the <hi>Cider</hi> will not be ſo good as that made of ſound Fruit well ripened. Therefore the middle way is the beſt, as hath by experience been obſerv'd.</p>
                  <p>Next to the gathering and hoarding <note place="margin">Of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Mill.</note> of your Fruit, the grinding them is to be conſidered. No <hi>Mill, Engine, Art,</hi> or <hi>way,</hi> having been yet uſed or diſcovered, better than the <hi>Mill</hi> deſcribed in my former Treatiſe of this Subject for the expeditious, eaſie, and even grinding of Apples, the Mill being eaſily portable ſtanding in little room, and of ſmall price, conſidering the quantities of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that in a little time may be ground by it. One Man may grind in this <hi>Mill</hi> of the <hi>double Roll,</hi> in one day, as many Apples as a Horſe can in a Horſe-Mill in three days. This Mill coſting from 3 <hi>l.</hi> to 10 <hi>l.</hi> and a Horſe-Mill from 20 <hi>l.</hi> to 30 <hi>l.</hi> with the room it is to work in. This taking up no more room than an ordinary Cheſt, and may be eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved as occaſion requires. The other muſt remain always fixt.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Mill</hi> grinds the Fruit even, bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing every part, yet breaketh not the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:107214:92"/> Kernels. The other grindeth it unevenly and breaketh the Kernels which preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diceth the <hi>Cider.</hi> Theſe new Mills of both ſorts were made of ſeveral prizes, as you would have them for diſpatch, by Mr. <hi>Henry Allen</hi> at the <hi>Cabinet</hi> in <hi>Exeter ſtreet</hi> near the <hi>Strand</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and now by many other ingenious Work-Men.</p>
                  <p>After the Apples are ground, if they <note place="margin">Ordering the Pulp after grinding.</note> were very mellow, it is good to preſs the pulp the next day, leſt the too long ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occaſion heat and an ill ſavour, and the Liquor not ſo eaſily ſeparable from the <hi>Feces</hi> or Murc, which will then ſtrain out with the Liquor.</p>
                  <p>But if the Apples were tough or hard, the long ſtanding of the Pulp diſſolves the more obdurate Particles, weakneth the Branchery or Veins that paſs through the whole fleſhy part thereof, by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and advantagious degree of putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, which makes it yield its Liquor the more freely, and is in ſome degree a maturation of it, aſwell as whilſt it was in the whole Apple; alſo the long ſtanding of the <hi>Pulp</hi> after it is ground, gives the <hi>Cider</hi> a better tincture than otherwiſe it
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:107214:93"/> would have, which it attracts from the <hi>Pill</hi> or <hi>Skin</hi> of the <hi>Apples.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the redneſs of the <hi>Skin</hi> in the <hi>Pulp</hi> lying long together with it, gives a tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture to the <hi>Cider,</hi> as doth that of <hi>Grapes</hi> to <hi>Wine.</hi> For the Grape whereof Claret is made, yieldeth a pale Wine as ſoon as it is preſſed; but ſuffered to continue ſome days on the red Husk, obtains the tincture it hath when brought to us.</p>
                  <p>As to the preſſing of <hi>Cider,</hi> although <note place="margin">Of the preſſing of Cider.</note> the greater Skrew-Preſſes make the quickeſt diſpatch, and preſs the hardeſt of any, yet for private Families they are chargeable and cumberſome, nor is it neceſſary to make ſo hard a preſſure as is uſually made by them. I have ſeen a Preſs made with an Iron-Skrew, that by it the Juice hath been ſo clean expreſſed, that it left the <hi>Murc</hi> almoſt dry enough to burn. There was at that place <hi>Cider</hi> made of <hi>Redſtreaks, Golden-Rennets, Golden-Pepins, Gilliflowers,</hi> and other of the beſt of <hi>Cider</hi> Fruits, and ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally each by it ſelf, a Hogſhead at leaſt of each ſort. But by reaſon of the too fine grinding and extream dry preſſure, the moſt curious Palat could diſtinguiſh
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:107214:93"/> but little difference in the Taſt, which was none of the beſt in every ſort. It was alſo ill-coloured and very cloudy; the laſt and much enforced Juice being very poor, and carries with it too much of the lignous part of the Apple, which had been more proper to have been left behind. For as all vinous Fruits have their pureſt part next the Skin or Pill, ſo is their richeſt Juice there contained, the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Air</hi> maturating ſuch Juice more perfectly on the extream parts than near the Core. The Pores are alſo much finer there than towards the middle, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in a diſſected Apple with the help of a <hi>Microſcope,</hi> which is the reaſon that Wines proceeding from Grapes without much preſſure, are preferr'd to thoſe that are more preſſed, and the pooreſt Wines are thoſe that are with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt force extracted. All which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it is better to have nine parts of pure rich <hi>Cider,</hi> than ten of that which hath neither good Taſt nor colour. Therefore ſo great a Preſs is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary in the making of good <hi>Cider.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:107214:94"/>
                  <p>As one of the conveniencies of the <note place="margin">A new ſort of Preſs.</note> Mill is to ſtand in a little room, and to be portable with eaſe from one place to another; the ſame is neceſſary in the Preſs, which may be made with two woodden Skrews, of about the ſize of the Skrews which the <hi>Apothecaries</hi> uſe in extracting Oils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which have a very great force or power with them, and placed at about 30 or 36 Inches diſtant, on a Bench or Form of about 20 or 24 Inches in breadth, according to this Figure.</p>
                  <p>The ſmallneſs of the Thread of the Skrew, although it requireth more time to work it, maketh it preſs the Murc much the harder; but you muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to fix the lower plank to ſome Poſt or Wall, by pieces extending from thence to the Preſs to keep it ſteady; with this may you preſs any quantities, ſmall or great at any time without much trouble; it is eaſily made, and requires but little room. And after your Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is over, you may ſet your Preſs as well as your Mill, in ſome by-place, till the next Seaſon requires its uſe again.</p>

                  <p>The Principal Cauſe that there hath <note place="margin">Ordering of Cider after it is preſſed.</note> been ſo much bad <hi>Cider</hi> made in moſt parts of <hi>England,</hi> was the too early ſtopping of it up. It being uſually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and as uſually practiſed, that as ſoon as <hi>Cider</hi> is preſſed, ſtrained and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, they ſtop it cloſe, with a very great confidence that unleſs it be cloſe ſtopt it will decay, and become of no uſe. So that when theſe <hi>Cideriſts</hi> have taken care for the beſt Fruit, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them after the beſt manner they could, yet hath their <hi>Cider</hi> generally proved pale, ſharp, ill taſted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all from the too early ſtopping of it. For the ſtopping of <hi>Cider</hi> cloſe before it be fine, or with its <hi>Feces</hi> in it (although precipated) begets reiterated fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which fermentations very much impoveriſh this Liquor, by precipitating thoſe Particles which enrich it with <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi> and <hi>Guſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilſt its groſs <hi>Feces</hi> or any ſetling remain in the bottom, every change of Weather cauſes ſome motion therein, which is uſually termed Fermentation: This doth ſo attenuate this Liquor, that it eaſily letteth or ſuffereth thoſe Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:107214:96"/> to ſubſide, and leaveth the <hi>Cider</hi> thin, jejune, acid, and ill taſted. It is thin and jejune, becauſe it hath loſt its ſubſtance; acid, becauſe it hath loſt its ſweetneſs, thoſe Particles being the Sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charine ſubſtance, or part of the Apple, and of ill ſavour and guſt, becauſe thoſe Particles when precipitated, being mixt with the more groſs, do putrifie and heat, infecting the whole maſs in the Veſſel, all which effects are apparently obvious in <hi>Cider</hi> made after the Vulgar method. Theſe <hi>Feces</hi> they are that cauſe the Corks to fly out of the Bottles, or break the Bottles; or at leaſt the opening of them makes the <hi>Cider</hi> fly, and mixing with it make the reſidue unpleaſant.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being generally taken <note place="margin">The vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Arts, uſed in mending of Cider.</note> notice of, hath ſet many heads at work to provide remedies. Some have made uſe of many ways to ferment it, and make it clear by reiterated Fermentations; others by additions, as <hi>Iſing-glaſs,</hi> &amp;c. have enforced a precipitation; and when they have ſo done, finding it to be thin, pale, and acid, have by <hi>Molaſſes, Treacle,</hi> or <hi>courſe Sugar,</hi> given it body, colour, and guſt. What delight or pleaſure there
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:107214:96"/> can be in drinking ſuch Compounds; or how much this muſt conduce to health or long life, I leave every unprejudiced and ingenious Man to judge.</p>
                  <p>There are others that when their <hi>Cider</hi> is thus reduced to a jejune and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant Drink, they take one Veſſel, and with an Alembick extract its Spirit, and add the ſame to another under the ſame circumſtances of poverty and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs, and then edulcorate it with <hi>Molaſſes, Treacle,</hi> &amp;c. which alſo gives it tincture. Theſe and many other Arts are uſed to ſophiſticate, corrupt, and debaſe, this otherwiſe pleaſant and wholſome Drink.</p>
                  <p>To prevent not only the decay of <note place="margin">Rules in making good Cider.</note> 
                     <hi>Cider,</hi> but the extraordinary trouble in curing and amending it. When it is preſſed let it ſtand a day or two, or more, in an open Tun, or covered only with a Cloth or Boards to keep it from the duſt, or in a Hogſhead or other Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, not quite full, with an open Bung, till the more groſs parts ſubſide: Then draw it into Pails, and fill it up into the Veſſels you intend to keep it longer in, leaving about an eighth part empty. Set
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:107214:97"/> theſe Veſſels in your coldeſt Cellars or Repoſitories, with the Bungs open, or covered only with a looſe Cover, that there may be a free perſpiration of the volatile Spirit of your <hi>Muſt,</hi> which would otherwiſe force its way; and that your <hi>Muſt</hi> may be cool, and not kept warm, leſt it ferment too much.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſtanding open, and the more open the better, it will by degrees let fall its groſſer parts, and in time become clear without the loſs of any of its true and durable Spirit. For coldneſs is here the cauſe of its purifying, warmth occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning the ſolution and detenſion of thoſe Particles that ſpoil the colour and taſt of <hi>Cider,</hi> and which otherwiſe would precipitate.</p>
                  <p>As for the time of its ſtanding open in the Veſſel, it varies according to the nature of the Fruit; If the fruit were mellow or ſweet, the more of the groſs particles be preſſed out with the Liquor, the longer time will be required for their precipitation: But if the Fruit were hard or ſharp, the thinner doth the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor iſſue out of the Preſs, and the ſooner will your <hi>Cider</hi> become fine; and you muſt be ſure to obſerve, that as ſoon
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:107214:97"/> as this <hi>Cider</hi> of hard Apples is fine, you draw it off from its precipitated Lee, leſt it become acid, or acquire ſome ill taſt from it.</p>
                  <p>This ſtanding open of the Veſſel cauſeth an expence of that wild or volatile Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which being pent in, would beget a continual fermentation much prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the <hi>Cider;</hi> and in caſe it doth not otherwiſe work its way out, would in time break the Veſſel that detains it.</p>
                  <p>After your <hi>Cider</hi> hath ſtood open <note place="margin">Ordering of Cider in the firſt Racking.</note> ſome reaſonable time, till it is become indifferently fine, which it may be in three, four, or five weeks; then will it be convenient to draw it into Bottles, if you have a ſufficient ſtock, or into other Cask, that it may there become more fine. For after it is ſeparated from its groſs <hi>Feces,</hi> it will more eaſily demit the remaining Particles or flying Lee, than it would have done whilſt the groſſer parts remained, renewing its fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on every change of Air, or other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental occaſion.</p>
                  <p>Its fineneſs will ſometimes plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if you move the ſcum aſide with a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:107214:98"/> Spoon, or the like; but to be more exact, you may take a Glaſs-Pipe of a Foot or more in length, open at both ends, ſtop the upper end of the Pipe with your Thumb, and let the other end down into the <hi>Cider</hi> as deep as you think fit, then open the upper end by removing your Thumb, and the <hi>Cider</hi> will riſe in the Pipe: Then ſtop the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end again with your Thumb, and take out the Pipe, and hold it over a Drinking-Glaſs, remove your Thumb, and you may there diſcern the ſtate and fineneſs of your <hi>Cider.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If your ſtock of <hi>Cider</hi> be not over-great, or that you are willing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your choiceſt ſorts of <hi>Cider,</hi> the beſt way is to have large Glaſs-Bottles of one or two Gallons apiece, more or leſs, enough to receive the ſame, into which draw off or rack your <hi>Cider,</hi> and let the Bottles ſtand open, or but barely cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in your cooleſt Repoſitory for a month or more, till you obſerve your <hi>Cider,</hi> by your interpoſing it between a Candle and your Eye, to be very tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, which then may be called Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine, the remaining Particles or flying

                  <p>If your quantity of your choiceſt <hi>Cider</hi> be too great for your Bottles, you may inſtead of them make uſe of Stone-Bottles, or Jarrs, or Stounds of Flanders-Earth, or glazed Earthen Veſſels, the larger the better, which may be placed in Rows in your Repoſitories, Cellars, or Vaults, and covered with Boards, or the like, to preſerve your <hi>Cider</hi> from duſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not from the Air. But by reaſon that you cannot ſo eaſily diſcern the fineneſs of your <hi>Cider</hi> in theſe as in the tranſparent Veſſels, you may now make uſe of your Glaſs-Pipe before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon why Glaſs-Bottles, or other glazed or ſtony-Veſſels are more fit for this ſecond fining, than thoſe of Wood, is, for that the coolneſs of the Veſſel very much contributes to the precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe remaining Particles that would otherwiſe debaſe this excellent Liquor.</p>
                  <p>But if your quantity of <hi>Cider</hi> be ſo great, that theſe Veſſels cannot receive it, then may you rack it into other Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels made very clean, dry, and ſweet, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107214:99"/> ſuffered to ſtand ſlightly covered till it be very fine, before you ſtop it up. If you find that your <hi>Cider</hi> doth not fine in wooden-Veſſels ſo ſoon as you deſire, for want of that coldneſs that is in the glazed-Veſſels, you may take Flints or pebble-Stones clean and dry, and put them into your Cask of <hi>Cider,</hi> this is ſaid (and with great probability) to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute much towards the nimble precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Feces.</hi> The like effect hath the applying of a bag of Salt to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the under part of the Veſſel.</p>
                  <p>When your <hi>Cider</hi> hath attained its <note place="margin">Ordering of Cider after it is ſuper-fine.</note> utmoſt degree of fineneſs, which after this way of ordering it will do, if you have but patience to let it ſtand open long enough, although ſome will fine in half the time that other requires: Then take your Glaſs <hi>Syphon</hi> or <hi>Crane</hi> and draw it off from its laſt <hi>Feces</hi> into ſmaller Bottles, wherein you intend to keep it for your uſe: Thus being drawn off, and throughly depurated, you may cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cork all your Bottles, and place them in your cool Conſervatory, where after a few weeks ſtanding your <hi>Cider</hi> will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a fine briskneſs, and mantle in the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:107214:99"/> Glaſs without any manner of feculency, and retain its firſt ſweetneſs, and change from a pale to a lively Canary or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laga-colour; but if you have occaſion to accelerate its maturity, place ſo many of your Bottles as you think you may have ſudden occaſion for, in ſome place warmer than your uſual Conſervatory, and it will ſoon anſwer your expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it will happen that the next Summer after it is become ſo pure, ſome Raggs or flying Feculencies may appear in your Bottles, which are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the warmth of the ſeaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting another fermentation from the fatneſs of the body of the <hi>Cider,</hi> made of the ſweeter ſort of Fruit, which are not apt to appear in the thinner <hi>Cider,</hi> but in ſome ſhort time theſe will ſubſide, and you may draw off the fine from the <hi>Feces</hi> with your <hi>Syphon,</hi> without any great prejudice to your <hi>Cider:</hi> Theſe later fermentations in great quantities of <hi>Cider</hi> often ſpoil it for want of a timely prevention, which cannot be ſo well done in Veſſels of Wood as thoſe of Glaſs, where you may eaſily perceive
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:107214:100"/> the various changes that may happen in theſe Liqours.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Syphons</hi> are beſt made of <note place="margin">To make Syphons or Cranes.</note> Glaſs, but becauſe that at the <hi>Glaſs-houſes</hi> the Workmen will not preſently appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how to turn them fit for this uſe; You may buy at the Glaſs or Potters-Shops thoſe Tubes or Pipes that are made of white or flint Glaſs for <hi>Barome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> or <hi>Mercurial Weather-Glaſſes,</hi> which may be carried in a long Caſe to any place in this Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Make a fire of <hi>Charcoal,</hi> or ſuch like clear fire at ſome diſtance from the back of the Chimney or Wall, and put the cloſe end of your Glaſs-Pipe into the fire, and when it is hot, dip about an inch of it in the water, and it will break off, then is your Pipe open throughout.</p>

                  <p>As for the ſize of the Pipes let them not be of too ſmall a bore, for then will the <hi>Cider</hi> be too long in drawing off: And as for the length, you may have of ſeveral lengths, that they may ſuit with your greater and leſſer Veſſels and Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and as near as you can proportion the ſize of the bore to the length of the <hi>Syphon,</hi> that your <hi>Cider</hi> may flow faſter out of the larger than out of the leſſer Veſſels.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Remember before you may uſe of your <hi>Syphon</hi> to whip about that Leg that

                  <p>Then put that end of the <hi>Syphon</hi> into the Bottle gently as deep as it will go, and move the Ring of Yarn to the very depth of the Bottle; then raiſe your <hi>Syphon</hi> ſo high as that the lower end of that Leg that is in the Bottle may be ſomewhat above the Lee that ſubſided in the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, for which the Ring of Yarn will be your guide, as at <hi>b. c.</hi>

                  <p>In the firſt part of this Treatiſe, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed <note place="margin">An Error corrected.</note> Fermentation to be a means to purifie <hi>Cider;</hi> and alledged that warmth was a principal help to provoke the ſame, as in truth it is: But ſuch Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that was at that time by many made uſe of, did very much prejudice <hi>Cider,</hi> and therefore to be prevented; There being no other Fermentation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in preparing the choiceſt <hi>Cider,</hi> than only expoſing it to the open <hi>Air,</hi> that the volatile Particles may evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and the <hi>Feces</hi> ſubſide, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would beget a reiterated Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, not only to the impoveriſhing of, but giving an ill Taſt to that which otherwiſe would prove the beſt <hi>Cider.</hi> The ſubſiding <hi>Feces</hi> having an ill Taſt and Smell, eaſily impart it to the <hi>Cider;</hi> as lately happened to one that by the advice of an ignorant <hi>Cideriſt,</hi> after he had drawn off his <hi>Cider</hi> from the Lee or <hi>Feces,</hi> put the ſaid <hi>Feces</hi> in a flannel Bag, uſually called <hi>Hypocrates his Sleeve,</hi> through which the <hi>Cider</hi> finely diſtilled,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:107214:103"/> and was very pleaſant to the Eye, but not drinkable by reaſon of its ill Taſt and Savour which it received from the <hi>Feces;</hi> ſo that in caſe the <hi>Cider</hi> ſo drawn off had ſtood long on thoſe <hi>Feces,</hi> that Taſt and Savour had infected the whole quantity, though not in ſo high a degree as it did the ſmall part diſtilled through the Flannel.</p>
                  <p>Some perſons have made great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities <note place="margin">Of Veſſels for the keeping of Cider.</note> of <hi>Ciden,</hi> and at the ſame time have diſpoſed it into ſeveral Veſſels. But the <hi>Cider</hi> although alike at the tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it up, yet at the drawing it forth, hath proved of different Taſt and other qualities, which very much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed the curious Obſervators to find out the cauſe of ſuch variance. At length they did obſerve that in all thoſe Veſſels that were made of the <hi>white Oak,</hi> the <hi>Cider</hi> was well coloured, and of a good Taſt; but in thoſe that were made of brown or red Oak, it was it contrary, ſo that they concluded the faults or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of <hi>Cider</hi> to be from the Veſſel. <hi>Quaere</hi> Whether the upright Veſſel whoſe Ribs are ſtreight, being made of <hi>Firre,</hi> may not be very proper for the keeping
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:107214:104"/> of <hi>Cider,</hi> it being probable that ſuch taſt and colour that may at the firſt be taken from the Firre, may rather mend than marr the <hi>Cider;</hi> however it will be ſooner extracted from it than from the Oak.</p>
                  <p>As for Hogſheads or other Veſſels <note place="margin">Earthern Veſſels the beſt.</note> made of Wood (when new) they are apt to ting the <hi>Cider</hi> with an ill colour, and give it an ill Taſt; and when they have been uſed, although with the ſame ſort of Liquor, they retain ſome tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous matter which diſturbeth the <hi>Cider</hi> newly put into it, and ſometimes ſo much that the <hi>Cider</hi> will hardly ever be clear; therefore the leſs time that <hi>Cider</hi> remains in the wooden-Veſſels the better it is: But to prevent ſuch ill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, Experience hath taught me, that open Veſſels of Glaſs, or glazed-Earth are the beſt, not only for the retaining the natural guſt and colour of the <hi>Cider,</hi> but for the better and more expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous purifying of it, having ſeveral times put ſmall quantities of <hi>Cider</hi> from the Preſs, formerly in Jar-Glaſſes, and ſince that in glazed Earthen-Pots, which in the ſame manner hath rendred the <hi>Cider</hi>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:107214:104"/> much exceeding that, which at the ſame time, and of the ſame ſort, hath been put in wooden-Veſſels and narrow-mouth'd Glaſs Bottels.</p>
                  <p>Therefore if you take Earthen-Veſſels glazed within that will hold four or five Gallons each (more or leſs) as many of them as will contain the <hi>Cider</hi> you make, and ſet them in Rows on the Ground and on Benches in your Cellar or Repoſitory, and fill them with <hi>Cider</hi> from the Preſs, and let them ſtand open, or but ſlightly covered four or five Weeks, or more, till the <hi>Cider</hi> be throughly fine, you may then Crane it off into Bottles for uſe; or you may by emptying one of the Veſſels draw it from the next into that which is empty, and ſo go round till all be drawn off; and then let it ſtand another month without the Lee till it be Superfine, and then draw it off into Bottles for uſe. If you live near a <hi>Potters</hi> you may have theſe Veſſels made with Tap-holes about two inches from the bottom, and ſo may with a Cane or ſmall Tap draw it off without the uſe of the <hi>Syphon,</hi> and leave the <hi>Feces</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.</p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:107214:105"/>
                  <p>Theſe Veſſels, all things conſidered, are cheaper than Barrels or Hogſheads of Wood: Firſt, for that you have more by the Gallon for your mony of the Earthen than of thoſe made of Wood; then will they laſt longer (with care;) for after the <hi>Cider</hi> is drawn off, you may ſcald them, and ſet them by, with their bottoms uppermoſt till another year, without danger of growing Muſty, or want of hooping.</p>
                  <p>In the Cellar or Conſervatory, they ſtand as in Figure 11; and when you have drawn off the upper Rows on the Benches, you may then ſet thoſe on the Ground, and upon the Benches in the room of the other, and ſo draw them off likewiſe; you may have alſo two or three Rows the one above the other.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the obſerving of the time of <note place="margin">Divers Ciders out of the ſame Apples.</note> gathering and grinding of Apples, which cauſeth a great Variety of <hi>Ciders;</hi> there is in the ſame Apple ſuch a difference in its parts, that the one part produceth a better <hi>Cider</hi> than the other. In oblong Pears the beſt part is that which is next the tail, that being the ſmalleſt end, the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:107214:105"/> whole ſubſtance of the Fruit paſſing throgh it, is the cauſe why that part is the beſt. In Apples the outſide is the beſt, being more maturated by the Sun and Air than next the Core, and there is the richeſt Juice contained; the Pores are alſo much finer there than towards the middle, as appears in a diſſected Apple by the help of a Microſcope. In Grapes the richeſt Juice is alſo next the Skin, and moſt eaſily expreſſed, which is the reaſon that Wines proceeding from Grapes, lying in large Veſſels without any other preſſure than their own weight, are much more excellent than thoſe that are forcibly expreſſed, which by all are found to be the pooreſt.</p>
                  <p>Therefore if you intend to have a more rich <hi>Cider</hi> than is ordinarily made out of the ſame Apples, you may pare the outſide of your Apples about the thickneſs of a Crown-piece of Silver, and grind theſe thick Rinds very fine (laying by the inſides to make a meaner ſort of <hi>Cider)</hi> by which you will ſoon find the difference, as well in colour as flavour.</p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:107214:106"/>
                  <p>But if you will have a rich coloured <note place="margin">Diverſly coloured alſo.</note> 
                     <hi>Cider,</hi> take of the reddeſt ſort of through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe <hi>Gillyflowers</hi> in <hi>November,</hi> and pare about a third or fourth part of them you intend to grind as thin as an old Six-pence, lay theſe parings by, then grind your Apples and preſs your <hi>Cider;</hi> afterwards when your <hi>Cider</hi> is diſpoſed of into its proper Veſſels (of which the Glaſs or Earthen are the beſt) add the parings you laid by, and let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the <hi>Cider</hi> 14 days more or leſs at your diſcretion, and when your <hi>Cider</hi> is fine, draw it off from thoſe parings; and although your <hi>Cider</hi> at the firſt ſeems not to have much of the colour of the parings, yet will it be ſo much improved by them, that in a few weeks its colour, guſt, and flavour will excel that which ſhall be made by any other way or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod; and the richer will it be if made of the Rinds pared thick, ground and preſſed without the inſides, as before is directed.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt part of this Treatiſe, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated <note place="margin">An Error an making Currant Wine cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</note> that by letting <hi>Currants</hi> hang on the Trees ſix or ſeven weeks after they
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:107214:106"/> are red, would digeſt and mature their Juice, that it needed not that large ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Sugar which otherwiſe it would do; which I concluded to be true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all or moſt of other Fruits become ſweeter by hanging long on the Trees after they are ripe, as <hi>Grapes, Cherries, Plums, Gooſeberries,</hi> &amp;c. But now I have obſerved that Currants only by long hanging on the Trees, after they are ripe, become more acid. Therefore they ought to be gathered as ſoon as they are through ripe, if you intend to make <hi>Wine</hi> of them. But if you intend them for <hi>Vinegar,</hi> the longer they hang the better, and this is the beſt uſe their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Juice can be put unto, it making the beſt Sauces of any other acid Juices; and its <hi>Wine,</hi> unleſs kept till the Sugar and the Liquor are throughly incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, is none of the moſt grateful to the Stomach.</p>
                  <p>Take a pound and a half of Loaf-Sugar, <note place="margin">To make Apricock-Wine.</note> the finer the better, to which put three pints of Spring Water, and ſo in that proportion for a greater and leſſer quantity; ſet this over the fire until it boil, and after you have clean ſcum'd it,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:107214:107"/> take a pound of Apricocks through ripe to each pint of Water, pare them thin, and ſtone them, and put them into the Liquor, and let them be boiled therein until they become tender; then take the Apricocks out, and put a Sprig of floured Clary into it, and after it hath boiled a little take it out, and let the Liquor cool; and when it is through cold put it into large Bottles, and let it ſtand eaſily ſtopt till it be very pure or fine, then Crane it off into quart or pint Bottles as you pleaſe, and cloſe ſtop and keep it for your uſe.</p>
                  <p>Note that the Wine is really a Sugar-Wine, and the finer the Sugar is the whiter will your Wine be; and it receives a very fine reliſh from the Apricocks, which yet remain firm and undiſſolved, and are fit for your Confectionary. The Clary gives it a Guſt like Canary Wine: If you keep this Wine two or three years till the Sugar is perfectly diſſolved or digeſted in it, it becomes one of the beſt of Artificial Wines. <hi>Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt.</hi>

                  <p>I have formerly given you ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt <note place="margin">Of Choco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</note> of the nature of the <hi>Cacao,</hi> with the manner of compounding of the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of <hi>Chocolate:</hi> I have little more to add, but that ſeveral Authors of the <hi>American Hiſtories</hi> have at large ſet forth the great Values that are ſet on the <hi>Cacao</hi> Nuts in thoſe parts, being eaten without any preparation, ſatiating, and not cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Stomach.

                  <p>Some eſteem that which is made of the Nuts alone, made into a Paſt and

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:107214:108"/> boil a while, till the water be well tinged with it.</p>
                  <p>Its Vertues are that it indiſpoſes the Body to ſleep, and ſo is good for thoſe that affect late Studies: It allayeth the Heats and Fumes that ariſe from a full or foul Stomach, and ſo is good after a Debauch in eating or drinking: It is proper in Headaches, Dizzineſs, Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies and Catarrhs, where there is a groſs habit of Body, and a cold heavy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and very effectual in opening Feminine Obſtructions.</p>

                  <p>Its preparation I have touched upon <note place="margin">Of Tea.</note> before: As for the Qualities and Virtues of it, I will add ſomething to what hath been written in the firſt Part; it hath much of the ſame Vertue as Coffee, by inabling Men that drink of it, to Lucu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations or late Studies, by driving off ſleep; yet without thoſe ill effects that Coffee commonly produces; it makes Men active and lively, which Coffee doth not; It clears the Head, and opens the Urniary paſſages; it prevents Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, taking it before you drink Wine; for being drank hot, it fills the Veins and other vacancies, which otherwiſe would attract the Wine. Its a great dryer, and therefore no Enemy to Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity. It removeth the Obſtructions of the Spleen and Gall: It is good againſt Crudities, cauſeth a good Appetite and Digeſtion. It vanquiſheth Dreams, eaſeth the Brain, and ſtrengtheneth the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Theſe are the Principal, but there are many more Vertues attributed to this, the beſt of our ſmall Water-drinks; and certain it is, that many ancient Men ſince the uſe of it in <hi>England</hi> have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved themſelves very lively, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>THe Original of Fountains being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and obſcure, is not ſo eaſily diſcovered, as ſome have thought. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs have many very able Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers attempted to do it; ſome ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining it to be from one, ſome from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cauſe.

                  <p>The firſt Opinion of the Original or <note place="margin">1. <hi>That Springs proceed from Rains.</hi>
                     </note> Cauſe of Springs and Fountains that hath inſinuated it ſelf, and is rivited into the Minds of moſt thinking Men, is, that they ariſe from Rains, diſſolved Snows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the Confirmation of which, much hath been ſaid and written.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. 1.</note>Againſt which Opinion, I will offer ſome Reaſons: As firſt, That there is a very great diverſity in the Wetneſs and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:107214:112"/> Drineſs of Years; in ſome Years it rains very much, and in others very little: And eſpecially in the Winter-Seaſons, it being eaſily to be computed that four or five times the quantity of Rains falls in ſome one Winter as doth in another; yet nevertheleſs do the perennial Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains flow, but little more in the more rainy Winter than in the other; or at leaſt the diſproportion of the Fountains is not anſwerable to that of the Rains: As may very plainly be obſerved in all Fountains iſſuing out of Rocky and Mountainous places. As in this beginning of the Spring 1685. the clear and ſwift Fountain flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with almoſt as full a ſtream from <hi>Alreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> to <hi>Wincheſter</hi> after almoſt two years drought, as it uſually hath done after the moſt Rainy-Seaſons. And in caſe there be any defect of Water in it now more than formerly, it may be imputed to the attractive vertue of the dry Earth near unto its Springs and Currents in ſo dry a Seaſon, rather than to its Original; the like I have obſerved in all perennial Fountains.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">2.</note>That there are many hilly places of ſeveral Miles extent, without any Springs or Fountains in any of the Valleys
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:107214:113"/> amongſt them, and the Lands on ſuch high places are fruitful and inhabited; and where the Rains fall equally plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as they do in the lower and larger Vales, yet are the Wells on ſuch high places digged very deep before they come to the Springs; and thoſe Waters cannot be ſuppoſed to be compounded of Rains, Snows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe Rains nor melted Snows deſcend not ſo deep. For if they did, then would the Earth, of what nature or kind ſoever it be, be imbib'd therewith from the Surface, to the reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place of ſuch Waters, and there would neceſſarily be a continual deſcent <hi>guttatim,</hi> eſpecially near the bottom of ſuch Wells or reſting-places to ſupply thoſe Fountains, which there is not, as appears in Caves that are deep in the Earth, and Conſervatories made for Snow, which are always dry. <hi>Cardanus libro quinto de ſubtilitate, dicit quod Cuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culos ad evertenda Oppida etiam ſub aqua effodiunt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">3.</note>Another Reaſon that induceth me to believe that Springs derive not their Original from Rain, diſſolved Snow or Hail, is for that there are plentiful Springs and Fountains under ſo great a
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:107214:113"/> quantity or thickneſs of Earth, Clay, or the like, that is not penetrable, or rather penetrated by theſe Waters that are on the Superficies of it. As is moſt evident on the great Flats near the Sea, which are overflown with Salt or brackiſh-Waters; yet by digging 40 or 50 Foot through a Bed of Clay, a Spring of moſt ſweet Water hath been diſcovered, when as the more Salt or brackiſh-Waters have not permeated through the Clay or Earth to mix with it notwithſtanding the vacuity of the Well was large enough to have received it. And it is as evidenr within the Land, where ſeveral ſmall perennial Rivers flow, yet very near the ſame, are Wells digged 15 or 20 Foot lower than thoſe Waters where Springs are found, which yield great plenty of Water, that have not their Original from Rain percolated through the Earth; for in caſe they had, then would thoſe Rivers deſcend alſo by the ſame Pores as did the Rain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">4.</note>A fourth Reaſon is, For that when Rains fall by eaſie Showers (as they generally do) the thirſty Earth imbibes and detains them very near its ſurface, and in a few dry days as eaſily imparts
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:107214:114"/> with its newly received moiſture, that ſometimes plentiful Showers (that in caſe they had been received in a glazed-Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, might have filled the ſame two inches deep,) in three or four days ſhall be for the moſt part exhauſted again. And this is plainly viſible in newly ared or ſandy barren Lands; and likewiſe in Grounds covered with Vegetables, ſuch Rains are ſoon imbib'd, and as ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of; yet under theſe Lands uſually iſſue out large and conſtant Fountains. For I know ſeveral conſtant Springs iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from under moſt barren, ſandy, heathy Grounds, that are never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to encreaſe after the greateſt Rains or moſt wet Seaſons, nor to leſſen after the drieſt; and thoſe ſandy Grounds for a great diſtance from thoſe Springs of no greater height, but that great Rains or Droughts would beget ſenſible alterations in ſuch Springs, had they no other Original than from Rains, or (indeed) had the Rains any commerce at all with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">5.</note>If we would but conſider further how all thoſe Waters are diſpoſed that fall by Rain and Snow, that alone might be a reaſon ſufficient to induce any one to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:107214:114"/> believe that Fountains and Springs have not from them their Original. Inſtead therefore of wondring what becomes of ſo great quantities of Rain and Snow, from whence Fountains and Springs ſhould proceed, if not from Rain and Snow, we may rather admire from whence ſo much Rain ſhould proceed. If it be ſaid to be a converſion of Air into Water, that cannot be, for Air is as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect body as Water, only it is more porous or ſpongy, and ſo more capable to be expanded and contracted than Water is; and thereby adapted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive great quantities of rarefied Water, and detain it until it be again condenſed into its firſt form: And if Rain be ſaid to be exhaled out of the Sea, that is very improbable as to the whole; in part it may, as from all moiſt Bodies. For Salt Water is not ſo apt to diſtil as ſweet Water is; nor do the great Rains (nor Winds which proceed from the ſame cauſe) come ſo often from the Maritime Coaſt as from the more Inland in the great Continents. But Rain is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly (as may be ſuppoſed with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and reſpect to the more Learned) thoſe Particles or Atoms, that by the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:107214:115"/> heat or virtue of the Sun, are exhaled from the Earth, Waters, Vegetables, and all moiſt Bodies through the pores of the Air, until they are by its frigidity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed into thoſe drops that diſtil in the uſual forms of Rain, Hail or Snow, ſo that no part of the Superficies of this Globe can be ſaid to be exempted from contributing to thoſe fruitful Showers that uſually bedew the ſame; which if it be granted, then the 19 inches and more of Water found by the <hi>French Anonymus Author</hi> to fall in every year, as is mentioned in Dr. <hi>Plots moſt ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tentamen de Origine Fontium,</hi> Sect. 27. may eaſily be ſuppoſed to be waſted in ſo many of the 365 days that happen to be dry, windy, froſty or hot, in which the moiſture of the Earth is uſually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled; for in the beginning of <hi>April</hi> 1685. an inch of Water expoſed to the Sun and Air in an Earthen-Veſſel was waſted in leſs than three days. And in caſe I ſhould preſume to ſay that much more Water was annually exhaled from the Terrene part of this Globe than deſcended on it by Rains, Snow or Hail: I believe I might find Credit amongſt ſome of thoſe that underſtand by what
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:107214:115"/> influence all things ſublunar, have their motion and encreaſe, which if true, then certainly thoſe vaſt Fountains that water this Earth have ſome other Original than Rain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in caſe it be objected by any, that the Exhalations from the Sea contribute much towards the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Rain: I anſwer, That much Rain alſo falls on the Sea, and not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably much more than ariſes from it.</p>
                  <p>Another Opinion ſome (and thoſe <note place="margin">2. <hi>That Springs proceed from the Sea.</hi>
                     </note> more Learned than the other) have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that Fountains proceed from the Sea by ſubterranean paſſages, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again above the Earth by way of Circulation; that Rivers never want, nor the Sea ſuperabounds with Water.</p>
                  <p>One Reaſon for that Opinion is, that <note place="margin">1. <hi>Reaſons for that Opinion.</hi>
                     </note> Wells or Pits digged near the Sea are filled with brackiſh-Water, and thoſe more diſtant with ſweeter, as ſaid <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus.</hi> And he was likewiſe of Opinion, that there were ſweet Waters under the bottom of the Sea, <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de ſubtilitate.</hi> It being moſt true, that ſuch Springs that are compoſed of Waters percolated through the Sauds, the farther from the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:107214:116"/> Sea they are, the more ſweet. But thoſe Springs or Fountains that proceed from another cauſe are as ſweet under the Sea as in the higheſt Mountains, as was that Fountain mentioned by <hi>Pliny, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 31. And as by ſeveral other Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples is demonſtrable.</p>
                  <p>Another Reaſon that ſeems to fortifie <note place="margin">A ſecond Reaſon.</note> that Opinion is, That many Springs, Fountains, and other Waters at great diſtances from the Sea, ebb and flow as doth the Sea next adjacent to ſuch Springs or Fountains, and that ſeveral Fountains are Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore they have a certain Commerce with the Salt Ocean. To which I may anſwer, That ſome Springs lying low and near the Sea may ebb and flow at the ſame time as doth the Sea, by the preſſure of the water in the Ocean againſt the looſe Sands, through which the other part of the Water paſſes that proceeds from the ſame Head: Nevertherleſs the Spring that ebbs and flows near <hi>Newton</hi> in <hi>Glamorganſhire,</hi> although but an 100 Paces from the <hi>Severn-Sea,</hi> is at the loweſt ebb when the adjacent Sea is at the higheſt Flood; and when it is low
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:107214:116"/> Water in the Sea, then is the Spring full. As Mr. <hi>Speed</hi> obſerv'd in his Deſcription of <hi>Glamorganſhire.</hi> But that the flux and reflux of Springs that ariſe at any great diſtance from the Sea ſhould be cauſed from the flux and reflux of the Sea, it doth not plainly appear; for that thoſe of any height or diſtance from the Sea do not uſually obſerve the times of the flux and reflux of the Sea: As that of <hi>Weeding-Well</hi> or <hi>Tides-Well</hi> in the <hi>Peak</hi> in <hi>Darbyſhire.</hi> And that the <hi>Cannenſian</hi> Territory near to the Lake <hi>Larius,</hi> which every hour ebbeth and floweth, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in <hi>Pliny, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 103. and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others; only that on the top of the Mountain in <hi>Flintſhire</hi> is mentioned by Mr. <hi>Hooke</hi> in his <hi>Micrography, p.</hi> 27. to ebb and flow as the Sea doth; but why then do not the Springs that are lower and nearer the Sea? As for Fountains that are Salt, it may be ſuppoſed that their ſaltneſs proceeds from ſome other cauſe than from its Commerce with the <hi>Sea.</hi> For if there could be no other cauſe, then muſt we ſuppoſe that there are <hi>Hot, Sulphureous, Bitumenous, Alumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous</hi> and <hi>Nitrous</hi> Seas, from whence Fountains of thoſe qualities proceed.</p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:107214:117"/>
                  <p>But if we ſeriouſly conſider upon <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Opinion.</note> what miſtake that Opinion is grounded, it will not be difficult to wave it, and embrace a more probable. For many are induced to believe that all perennial Fountains derive their Original from the Sea firſt by large ſubterranean paſſages or canals, and then divided into ſmall capillary Pipes; and ſo by the immenſe weight of the Air on the Ocean, ſuch Water is forced into ſmaller Fountains on the higheſt parts of the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents; as <hi>Quick-ſilver</hi> by the weight of the <hi>Air</hi> without, is raiſed in the Tube of the <hi>Barometer</hi> within. Or as <hi>Water</hi> is raiſed in <hi>Glaſs-Pipes</hi> above the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the <hi>Water</hi> without, by the preſſure of the <hi>Air</hi> on the ſame, which to me ſeemeth a very great Miſtake.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe if you fill the <hi>Tube</hi> with <hi>Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver,</hi> and with your Finger, or a piece of Leather, ſtop the open end thereof, then invert the <hi>Tube,</hi> and ſuffer rhe <hi>Quick-ſilver</hi> to ſtrain out at very ſmall paſſages below, it will deſcend equally to the ſame height, as if the end were placed in a <hi>Stagnum</hi> of the ſame <hi>Quick-ſilver;</hi> therefore it cannot be the preſſure
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107214:117"/> of the <hi>Air</hi> without on the <hi>Stagnum</hi> that muſt ſupport the <hi>Cilinder</hi> of <hi>Quick-ſilver</hi> in the <hi>Tube;</hi> for in caſe alſo that you fill a <hi>Tube</hi> with a ſmall bolt-head on it with <hi>Quick-ſilver,</hi> and invert it, that whilſt you ſtop the lower end, the <hi>Tube</hi> is evenly full as in the <hi>Barometer;</hi> yet when you remove your Finger, the <hi>Quick-ſilver</hi> will deſcend ſo far as the extended <hi>Air</hi> will permit it, which will be much lower than that in the <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter.</hi> Now if the weight of the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Air</hi> on the Stagnant <hi>Quick-ſilver</hi> were the cauſe of the aſcent of the <hi>Cilin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of <hi>Quick-ſilver</hi> within, then would that ariſe in the headed <hi>Tube</hi> equally as high as it doth in the <hi>Barometer;</hi> for it is not to be ſuppoſed that the weight of ſo ſmall a quantity of <hi>Air</hi> in the head ſhould depreſs that which of neceſſity muſt be ſupported by a greater weight without, as is pretended.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it is moſt apparent that any warmth artificially applied to the head of the <hi>Thermometer</hi> cauſeth the Water in the <hi>Tube</hi> to ſink, and Cold to riſe, whereby it indicates the temper of the <hi>Air</hi> ambient on the head, rather than of the whole body of the <hi>Air</hi> as high as
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:107214:118"/> the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> which laſt ſome have ſuppoſed by its weight on the <hi>Stagnum</hi> to ſupport the Water in the <hi>Tube.</hi> The ſame is in the <hi>Barometer,</hi> but with allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as to the difference between <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Quick-ſilver.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the aſcent of Water in Glaſs-Pipes open at both ends in the ſmaller Pipes higher than in the larger, that may very well be ſuppoſed to ariſe from the attractive or ſympathetical vertue in the Glaſs, becauſe the nearer the ſides of the Glaſs are the one to the other, the higher doth the Water aſcend; for if the Pipes are ſhort, or ſo depreſſed, that the tops are near the ſurface, the Water will not riſe high enough to flow over, although the weight of the ambient <hi>Air</hi> on the <hi>Stagnum</hi> be the ſame, by reaſon that the attraction is leſſened thereby. All ſypho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Filtrations, and Mr. <hi>Hookes</hi> Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in his <hi>Micrography,</hi> are from the ſame cauſe.</p>

                     </note> the truth of this matter, is, that hinted at by the Learned Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet, in the fourth Chapter of the third Book of his Origines Sacrae;</hi> which is, that the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior heat of the Earth cauſeth a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Evaporation of the ſubterranean Waters, which by the cold Superficies are condenſed into Fountains.</p>
                  <p>To maintain which, it muſt be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that the Earth, as one great Animal, containeth in it a Central heat, which by its own motion (as from the heart in the Body) cauſeth that continual Evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <head>Of the true Original of Springs.</head>
                  <p>IF the Celeſtial Sun be placed in the Center of the Univerſe, virtually giving life and heat to all things that live and move, according to the Laws of Nature inſtituted by God himſelf, as I hope none will deny; It is not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſible heat of the Air, by what ſoever Accident warm'd, that makes Vegetables flouriſh in the Spring more than in the Autumn. For the Weather is uſually much more temperate and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly hot in the Autumn than in the Spring: Nor is it the external warmth of the Months of <hi>September</hi> or <hi>October</hi> that excites the Venereal Faculty in moſt Animals, eſpecially Fowl; but it is the Virtual Influence of the Sun in its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to his <hi>Northern Hemiſphere,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in cold <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> that impregnateth the far greater part of Vegetables and Animals with a power to vegetate, increaſe and multiply.</p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:107214:119"/>
                  <p>It is not the preſſure of the Air, nor the crowding of it into the Pores of the Earth that forceth the aſcent of Sap in Trees; nor is that ingenious contrivance of the Laborious Dr. <hi>Grew</hi> in his <hi>Anatomy of Plants, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>part</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. that gives an aſcent of Sap in Vegetables. But it is the virtual power of the Sun that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts the Sap into the Branches from the Root; after it hath given the Seed or Root a power to attract the Aqueous Spirit from the Earth. For it is moſt plain, that Seeds ſown, or Trees ſtanding in Earth not wet, or abounding with moiſture, will nevertheleſs attract a far greater quantity of that Aqueous Spirit for its nouriſhment, than that Earth contain'd within the extent of their Roots. For the Atoms of moiſture that continually perſpire, are intercepted by the attracting Roots of Vegetables, where they lie in their way.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore as Fountains have their Original and Courſe by the Laws of Nature after a moſt certain and ſure Method; why may we not imagine that the virtual Influence of the Sun on this Orb of Earth, moving by a certain Rule and Order, may not excite, and by
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:107214:120"/> attraction beget a continual Evaporation or Perſpiration of moiſture from the ſubterraneal parts thereof, which by the condenſation of its ſuperficial Cortex, may reduce part of ſuch perſpiring Atoms into plentiful Fountains. And thoſe again by flowing into the great Receptacles of Water, the Seas ſupply thoſe defects, ſo great an attraction might otherwiſe be the cauſe of.</p>
                  <p>It may alſo be ſuppoſed, that this Virtual Influence of the Sun, by the ſame Law of Nature, attracts all thoſe Atoms from the Earth that are not condenſed into Fountains as well as thoſe from the Sea, that afterwards are condenſed by the Air, and ſo plentifully beſprinkle this Globe, and in ſome places make ſo great Inundations.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then that <hi>Fountains, Rains</hi> and <hi>Snows</hi> may probably proceed from one and the ſame Cauſe. The diſcovery of the Original Cauſe of <hi>Rain, Snow,</hi> &amp;c. may make that of Fountains more eaſily to be apprehended. It will not be amiſs therefore to offer ſome Conſiderations concerning <hi>The Original Cauſe of Rain,</hi>

                  <p n="1"> 1. The height of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> may be conſidered, which ſome ſuppoſe to be about three Miles in height, above the Superficies of the moſt even part of the Earth, above which no Clouds move. Dr. <hi>Brown</hi> in his <hi>Enquiries into Vulgar Errors, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. is of Opinion, that the remoteſt diſtance of Clouds is but two miles; which ſeems very rational, if we conſider, that on Mountains a Man may ſee over the Clouds every way. And that as the ſame Author, <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. ſeems to allow the perpendicular altitude of the higheſt Mountain to be but four Miles. And the Account that Dr. <hi>Sprat</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtory of the Royal-Society,</hi> gives of the <hi>Pico</hi> in <hi>Teneriff,</hi> relates it to be but two Miles and an half, yet eſteems it to be the higheſt in the World, whoſe top is thought to tranſcend any Clouds, at leaſt ſuch that afford Rain or Snow.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It may alſo be conſidered, that Clouds carrying <hi>Rain, Snow, &amp;c.</hi> move not far before they waſt themſelves, or diſtil on the Surface of this Globe: For great <hi>Rains</hi> have fallen on ſeveral parts of this Iſland, when on other parts about the ſame time none have fallen. Great Thunders have alſo happened in ſome
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:107214:121"/> places, when at 15 or 20 Miles diſtance they have not been heard. <hi>Cardanus, lib.</hi> 17. <hi>de ſubtilitate,</hi> will not allow the Clouds to be above 500 Paces, or half a Mile in height, and viſible not above 30 Miles. That a Man being in <hi>Milan</hi> cannot tell when it rains in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. If then that Clouds aſcend no higher, nor are carried far; then muſt they ariſe and encreaſe near where they fall, which is not difficult to demonſtrate; It being conſpicuous to every Eye, that Clouds, eſpecially ſuch that are moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to afford <hi>Rains,</hi> &amp;c. do from a very ſmall beginning encreaſe in view to be large and ſhowring, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fall not far from the place of their Original. And whereas it is vulgarly apprehended that <hi>Rains</hi> are exhaled from the Sea, and carried by the Wind over the Land; it is againſt Reaſon to imagine that the <hi>Rains</hi> that come with a Northern-Wind, and fall in the South parts of this Iſland, ſhould derive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Northern-Seas, and be carried with ſo gentle a gale as they ſometimes come withall, over ſo large a tract of Land 3 or 400 Miles, and not demit ſo great a burden of Water; and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:107214:121"/> much more unreaſonable would it be to think, that all thoſe great <hi>Rains</hi> that come from the Northweſt in the great Continent of <hi>North-America</hi> to the <hi>New-Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Virginean-ſhore,</hi> and thoſe that fall under the <hi>Meridian-line</hi> in <hi>Africa</hi> ſhould be no otherwiſe extracted than from the remote Seas 30 Degrees, or 1800 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles diſtant; eſpecially there in thoſe hot Countries, and here in the warmer Seaſons, when <hi>Rains</hi> fall more precipitouſly than where it is colder.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If <hi>Rains,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould be no other than Exhalations from the Sea: It muſt be conſidered how all thoſe Vapours and Exhalations from the Earth, from Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Rivers, from Vegetables and Animals, are diſpoſed of. For in Summer time, if you imbible dry Earth with Water, it will in a few days be exhaled by the Sun, as is evident by a Summer <hi>Rain</hi> that would in an Earthen-Veſſel have raiſed an inch or more of Water, in the ſpace of three or four hot days will be exhaled into Vapours. The ſame is to be obſerved in Rivers, Ponds, Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that daily Exhalations do ariſe from them, eſpecially in the Summer time: And from Vegetables alſo, which
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:107214:122"/> attract unto themſelves very much of the ſubterraneal Aqueous Spirit, or <hi>Spiritus Mundi,</hi> which Vegetables do daily (throughout the Spring and Summer time eſpecially) emit great quantities of Aqueous Particles. As ſome Trees have Floods of ſuch like flowing a long time through their Trunks and Branches into their Leaves, and thence into the Air; as the <hi>Birch,</hi> the <hi>Vine,</hi> the <hi>Walnut,</hi> &amp;c. A plain demonſtration thereof is alſo to be ſeen in an Acre of Meadow-graſs, which being cut in a hot Seaſon, loſeth in two days time three or four Tun of its weight, which is attracted by the Air. And eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Animal, of any indifferent ſize, as well as Man, daily perſpires ſome quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of moiſture. And the <hi>Air</hi> being a ſpongy Body, and two Miles and more in height, may eaſily be ſuppoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Water enough (being rarefied) to raiſe 19 inches and much more, in leſs than a years time, being condenſed into Showers.</p>

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:107214:126"/> thoſe plentiful Showers, but thoſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains with Water, that throughout the year, ſo plentifully flow from the midſt of ſo large and dry a Territory.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sun</hi> about the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> is perpendicularly over the <hi>Equinoctial-Line;</hi> it is ſuppoſed that then the <hi>Nile</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins; and about that time the influence of the <hi>Sun</hi> may forceably attract from the inner parts of the Earth an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of thoſe particles of Water that may cauſe ſo great <hi>Rains</hi> that ſhortly after happen. And as the <hi>Sun</hi> moveth towards the <hi>Tropic</hi> of <hi>Cancer,</hi> ſo doth its Influence operate: For from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of <hi>April</hi> to the tenth of <hi>June</hi> the Winds begin to riſe from the <hi>Meridian-Line</hi> to the <hi>Tropic</hi> of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and ſome ſhort Showers fall during that time.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Vapours or Exhalations thus attracted by degrees, ſo ſoon as they touch the cold Region, are condenſed and diſtil <hi>guttatim</hi> in ſmaller Showers; but after the <hi>Suns</hi> longer continuance over thoſe parts, and the attraction grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more ſtrong, thoſe Showers or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſations are the greater, that from the <hi>Suns</hi> entrance into <hi>Cancer</hi> they encreaſe, and during the month of <hi>July,</hi> and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:107214:126"/> whilſt the <hi>Sun</hi> is in <hi>Leo,</hi> the <hi>Rains</hi> are very violent, and then by degrees leſſen till they end, which is about the time of the <hi>Suns</hi> croſſing the <hi>Equinoctial-Line</hi> in its Return towards the <hi>Southern-Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that it may with great reaſon and probability be ſuppoſed that the daily Perſpirations and Exhalations from this <hi>Globe</hi> of Earth are treaſured in the ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous body of <hi>Air</hi> during the diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued times of <hi>Rain,</hi> which in ſome parts of the Country through which the <hi>Nile</hi> runs, happens to be from the end of <hi>September</hi> to the beginning of <hi>April;</hi> and that afterwards the more direct Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the <hi>Sun</hi> penetrating deeper into the bowels of the Earth, doth excite the heat that is there. (For it is by none denied, that the deeper any Mines or Cavities are ſunk into the Earth, the warmer is it,) which cauſeth ſo great a perſpiration of that <hi>Mundane</hi> Spirit, or of Aqueous Particles, that they fill and expand the <hi>Air.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sun-beams</hi> penetrating through the <hi>Air,</hi> thus replete with moiſture, may be the cauſe of thoſe great heats that are between it and the Earth. For the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:107214:127"/> 
                     <hi>Sun</hi> gives a greater heat through <hi>Glaſs,</hi> than through the <hi>Air</hi> only. And the more of moiſture there is in the <hi>Air,</hi> ſo it be finely rarified and tranſparent (as expanded <hi>Air</hi> is) the more violent is the heat of the <hi>Sun-beams</hi> penetrating through it; and ſuch ſultry heats gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally preceed Rains or Tempeſts in the Summer-time.</p>
                  <p>After the Celeſtial and Central <hi>Sun</hi> have thus furniſhed the <hi>Air</hi> with Matter, the ſtronger influence of the Celeſtial <hi>Sun</hi> raiſeth or attracteth the ſame unto the cold Region of the <hi>Air,</hi> which by moſt is ſuppoſed not to be above two Miles and ½ or three Miles above us, where thoſe Particles of Water ſo finely rarified, are condenſed by cold into more denſe or groſs Bodies, which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the forms of Clouds, and ſoon find their way downwards.</p>
                  <p>Where the <hi>Air</hi> is more groſs, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation weak, and the ſuperior Region temperate, as in the more oblique or Northerly parts, there the diſtillations are ſmaller. But where the Exhalations are ſtrong and forceable, the ſuperior Region extream cold, and the <hi>Air</hi> more Rare, as it is nearer the <hi>Equinoctial-Line</hi>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:107214:127"/> than at a great diſtance, as appears by the ſeverity of the cold on the <hi>Pico</hi> at <hi>Teneriffe,</hi> and other Southerly Mountains, where the Snows lie throughout the year, there the Rains are violent and extr,eam.</p>
                  <p>From theſe Exhalations rarified may Winds and Tempeſts proceed: For when the <hi>Sun</hi> approacheth, the Tropic of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, the Clouds and Northern Winds move towards thoſe Parts (as may be ſuppoſed) by attraction. For the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the <hi>Sun</hi> attracts thoſe exhaled Vapours from thoſe Northern Parts of <hi>Africa</hi> (that lie low on the <hi>Mediterranean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore)</hi> ſomewhat farther on the Continent, where the cold Region of the Air hath more power to condenſe them than on the <hi>Egyptian</hi> coaſt (where it ſeldom rains) from which Vapours proceed thoſe Winds: As may be obſerved in this Iſland, that Winds oftentimes proceed from moving Clouds, ſometimes from one ſide of the Cloud, and ſometimes from the other. And it is alſo obſerved, that ſoon after Miſts aſcend the Hills, Winds as well as Rains follow: Therefore Winds may not be ſuppoſed to derive their Original from any remote Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>But it may be objected, That thoſe
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:107214:128"/> great <hi>Rains</hi> that water the vaſt: <hi>African Territory,</hi> over which the <hi>Nile</hi> flows, are the Exhalations from the <hi>Mediterranean-Sea</hi> carried by the Northern Winds over it, at the times when the <hi>Nile</hi> begins to ſwell.</p>
                  <p>To which it may be anſwered, That it is very improbable that ſo great a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Water can be exhaled out of that Sea, and carried ſo near to the Earth, to ſo great a diſtance as the head of <hi>Nile,</hi> without being demitted before it come a quarter of the way; the greatneſs of the Burthen and the thinneſs of the <hi>Air</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, ſuch a <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably to be demonſtrated, nor is it eaſily apprehenſible to conſiſt with Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>For thoſe Rains that fall on thoſe Parts muſt be great, for that they water a vaſt dry Territory, which may require ſeveral inches of Water to moiſten it, two or three Foot in depth, beſides the raiſing of ſo great a Flood as the <hi>Nile,</hi> which increaſeth from <hi>June 17th</hi> to <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 24th,</hi> and then runs in a declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition till <hi>May</hi> following; which River is ſaid to water, by its divided Streams, the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> at the mouth
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:107214:128"/> thereof about 140 Miles in breadth, or at leaſt its fertile part, and uſually riſeth 24 Cubits perpendicular at the height of its Flood, as Mr. <hi>Sandys</hi> relates.</p>
                  <p>Now if thoſe Rains do not derive their Original ſolely by Exhalations from the Sea, as is nor reaſonably to be ſuppoſed; then is it very likely that they may be Exhalations from the Earth: And if they are ſuch, then may all perennial Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains be derived from the ſame Original. For thoſe Aqueous Particles that from the warm interior parts of the Earth, are attracted by the <hi>Suns</hi> ſuperior Influence, or otherwiſe howſoever to the Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies thereof, may part of them perſpire, and part be intercepted by Minerals, Vegetables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and other part by the cold Rocks, Sands, Clays, Chalk, or the like, be condenſed into Fountains.</p>
                  <p>If therefore that Rains and Fountains have the ſame Original, then is it not the weight of the Sea that enforceth the Waters through ſmall ſubterraneous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages to the middle of <hi>Africa,</hi> or any other place to the forming of Fountains. Nor is it the weight of the Saline ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Sea that preſſeth, the lower part being lighter and leſs ſalt, to the aſcent
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:107214:129"/> of ſuch high and remote places where uſually Fountains flow, as Mr. <hi>Hooke</hi> in his <hi>Micrography</hi> would have it.</p>
                  <p>For thoſe large Fountains, or rather Floods that iſſue out of divers Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous parts of the World, are too great to be derived from Rains; and if en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced thither through ſubterraneal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals by the weight of the Sea, Whence then proceed Rains? And whence do proceed thoſe trickling Waters, and many excellent and exuberant Springs that iſſue out near the tops of the leſſer Mountains about the <hi>Pico</hi> at <hi>Teneriffe,</hi> but from thoſe penetrating and perſpiring Streams condenſed by thoſe extream cold Rocks?</p>
                  <p>If what is remiſed be true, then may it be demonſtrable how the Rivers, Floods, Fountains and Springs flow into the Sea, which ſupplieth the interior parts of the Earth with matter ſufficient to maintain thoſe perſpiring vapours that continually aſcend to maintain thoſe Rivers, Floods, Fountains and Springs. So that there hath been, is, and ever ſhall be a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Revolution of thoſe Waters in which is contained the Natural ſpirit and life of every Animal, Vegetable and Mineral, in the <hi>ſublunar World.</hi>

                  <p>The cauſes of the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea, of Tempeſts, Winds, Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, various diſpoſitions of Airs, Heats, Droughts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not difficult to be diſcovered, the before-mentioned Powers and Influences being granted. For if you obſerve in Fig. 11. at <hi>g.</hi> how ſmall a proportion one of thoſe diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of 10 miles is to the Semidiater of the Earth, then muſt one mile be ſo much ſmaller, <hi>viz.</hi> as 1 to 3500; Then conſider that the higheſt Tide on our European-Coaſt is not above 70 Foot perpendicular, which is more than 71 times contained in one of thoſe miles, which is almoſt imperceptible, being ſo great a diſproportion to the Semidiame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Globe; whence it may eaſily be ſuppoſed, that the <hi>lunar</hi> influence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated by the <hi>ſolar,</hi> may by attraction cauſe ſo ſmall a motion as the Flux of the Sea.
